    "title": "Brain Imaging of Childhood Onset Psychiatric Disorders, Endocrine Disorders and Healthy Volunteers",
    "description": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unlike X-rays and CT-scans does not use radiation to\r\ncreate a picture. MRI use as the name implies, magnetism to create pictures with\r\nexcellent anatomical resolution. Functional MRIs are diagnostic tests that allow doctors\r\nto not only view anatomy, but physiology and function. It is for these reasons that MRIs\r\nare excellent methods for studying the brain.\r\n\r\nIn this study, researchers will use MRI to assess brain anatomy and function in X and Y\r\nchromosome variation, healthy volunteers, and patients with a variety of childhood onset\r\npsychiatric disorders. The disorders include attention deficit disorder, autism,\r\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia, childhood-onset schizophrenia, dyslexia, obsessive\r\ncompulsive disorder, Sydenham's chorea, and Tourette's syndrome.\r\n\r\nResults of the MRIs showing the anatomy of the brain and brain function will be compared\r\nacross age, sex (gender), and diagnostic groups. Correlations between brain and\r\nbehavioral measures will be examined for normal and clinical populations....",
    "eligibility": "-  INCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n\r\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the\r\nfollowing criteria:\r\n\r\nInclusion criteria for healthy controls\r\n\r\nParticipants consenting to participation in the study\r\n\r\n-Over 3 years of age with no upper limit for age at time of enrollment.\r\n\r\nInclusion criteria for MRI scanner calibration project:\r\n\r\nParticipants will meet protocol criteria for adult healthy volunteers.\r\n\r\nInclusion criteria for affected participant populations:\r\n\r\n-Male and female participants over 3 years of age with no upper limit for age (with the\r\nexception of the Down syndrome group - see below). Currently meet criteria for at least\r\none of the following:\r\n\r\n  -  DSM-IV (or other approved) criteria for one of the following clinical diagnoses:\r\n     Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Childhood Onset Schizophrenia, Turner Syndrome,\r\n     Autism Spectrum Disorder, Asperger Syndrome, High Functioning Autism, Pervasive\r\n     Development Disorder\r\n\r\n  -  ICD-10 criteria for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, Cushings Syndrome, Kallmann\r\n     Syndrome, Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.\r\n\r\n  -  ADHD\r\n\r\n  -  Chromosomal aneuploidies including Down s Syndrome and Sex chromosome aneuploidy as\r\n     determined by karyotype (including XXX, XXXX, XXXXX, XXY, XXYY, XXXY, XXXXY, XYY,\r\n     and XO).\r\n\r\nAdditional Inclusion criteria for Down Syndrome participants:\r\n\r\n  -  Confirmed chromosomal diagnosis of Down syndrome.\r\n\r\n  -  Age at entry into the study is 30 years or under. This upper age limit at study\r\n     entry is being implemented for the Down syndrome group for several reasons. First,\r\n     much of the research using magnetic resonance imaging with this population is\r\n     focused on (older) adult populations and in particular the transition to early onset\r\n     Alzheimer s disease. Because most (if not all) individuals with Down syndrome\r\n     demonstrate some brain pathology consistent with Alzheimer s disease by age 30\r\n     (e.g., plaques and tangles; Mann & Esiri, 1989), we would like to enroll\r\n     participants who are 30 years of age and under. Second, studying children and young\r\n     adults with Down syndrome fills a significant gap in the literature, as there are\r\n     very few structural magnetic resonance imaging studies of children and young adults\r\n     with Down syndrome reported in the literature to date, and the majority of these\r\n     studies are characterized by small samples of convenience (i.e., clinic\r\n     populations). Thus, there is still a need to describe the developmental course of\r\n     this disorder from early childhood to young adulthood. Such developmental research\r\n     may help shed light on the causes of intellectual disability in Down syndrome and\r\n     also identify individuals with the syndrome who are most at risk for experiencing\r\n     the cognitive decline that is reported in the literature for some individuals after\r\n     the age of 30 (Oliver et al., 1998).\r\n\r\nInclusion criteria for parents and siblings of affected participant populations:\r\n\r\nParticipants consenting to participation in the study\r\n\r\n  -  Over 3 years of age with no upper limit for age at time of enrollment.\r\n\r\n  -  Parents must have the ability to understand and provide informed consent to the\r\n     study.\r\n\r\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n\r\nNIMH staff and their immediate family are excluded from participation.\r\n\r\nExclusion criteria for healthy controls:\r\n\r\n  -  Presence of severe psychiatric disorder (as diagnosed prior to participant study\r\n     enrollment) in the participant. For these purposes, exclusionary severe psychiatric\r\n     disorder includes schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder.\r\n\r\n  -  Presence or history of medical conditions known to affect cerebral anatomy.\r\n\r\n  -  Dental braces.\r\n\r\n  -  Contraindications for MRI scanning according to the NMR Center MRI Safety Screening\r\n     Questionnaire and guidelines.\r\n\r\n  -  For females who have reached menarche: Pregnancy or inability or unwillingness to\r\n     undergo pregnancy testing.\r\n\r\nExclusion criteria for all affected participant populations, including parents and\r\nsiblings of the affected participants:\r\n\r\n  -  Dental braces.\r\n\r\n  -  Contraindications for MRI scanning according to the NMR Center MRI Safety Screening\r\n     Questionnaire and guidelines.\r\n\r\n  -  For females who have reached menarche: Pregnancy or inability or unwillingness to\r\n     undergo pregnancy testing.\r\n\r\n  -  Evidence of another medical condition or traumatic event known to affect cerebral\r\n     anatomy.\r\n\r\n  -  A known genetic disorder (other than the condition under investigation) that would\r\n     be expected to significantly impact findings from cognitive testing and/or\r\n     neuroimaging.",

    "description": "Background:\r\n\r\n  -  Many psychiatric, behavioral, and developmental disorders are genetic. This means\r\n     that they tend to run in families. Some begin in childhood, while others do not\r\n     appear until adulthood. Researchers want to look at people of all ages who have\r\n     these disorders that started in childhood. They will also look at relatives of\r\n     people with these disorders. This information will allow doctors to learn more about\r\n     childhood behavioral problems and how they are inherited.

    "title": "Proteomic Biomarker Tests in Blood Samples from Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)",
    "description": "Behavioral testing is the gold standard for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\r\nThese tests, including ADOS and ADI-R, are subjective, require trained staff to\r\nadminister, are time-consuming, and can only be administered at a later age. Blood-,\r\nurine- or stool-based diagnostic biomarker test for ASD would enable objective early\r\ndiagnosis, potentially even before clinical symptoms are present, eliminate the need for\r\ntrained staff and enable early intervention. Such a test would not only conserve money\r\nand time but would also provide clues to ASD pathogenesis.\r\n\r\nTo date, no definitive treatment exists for ASD. Most therapies are symptom-focused,\r\ngenerally focusing on behavioral, social and communication skills. Recent works have\r\nreported on promising outcomes of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment of children with\r\nASD. MSCs are multipotent, non-hematopoietic, easily isolatable and expandable stem cells\r\ninvolved in tissue repair, immunomodulatory responses and neuromodulation. MSC treatment\r\nof children with ASD has reportedly led to improvements in speech, sociability, eye\r\ncoordination, balance, cognition and overall well-being. At the base of this approach\r\nlies the known plasticity of the human brain and immune system in the early childhood\r\nyears and the ability of MSCs to modulate atypical inflammatory and immune activities.\r\nAssessment of ASD biomarker profiles in children with ASD who have undergone one or more\r\nSCT sessions may shed light on the mechanism of action, assist in better defining\r\nASD-specific diagnostic markers and monitor treatment outcomes.",

    "description": "Locomotor, transport and information functions in human body systems are carried out by\r\nactive media in autowave regimes! Any living organism is a (micro-macro-mega) hierarchy\r\nof autowave subsystems-an ensemble of loosely coupled subsystems of a simpler structure.\r\nFrom the highest levels of the hierarchy, Autowave Codes-Signals arrive, which determine\r\nthe transitions of subsystems from one autowave regime to another Autowave interaction\r\n(of Complex Coherent Action). Autowave interaction is a process associated with the\r\nevolution and interaction of spatial and wave structures in the active media of the\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nChaos in organism functioning tells about health. Periodicity - Autowave reverberator may\r\npresage a disease - Autism Spectrum Disorder; Chaotic nature of oscillations in active\r\nmedia of physiological systems is more optimal for their vital functions than periodic\r\none. Firstly, systems that function in chaotic regimes, can re-arrange themselves faster\r\nand easier in case of change of environmental conditions, i.e. the so called adaptive\r\ncontrol is more easily implemented in them. Secondly, \"spreading\" of oscillations\r\nstrength along comparatively wide frequency band takes place in chaotic regime.\r\n\r\nWhen an organism is young and healthy, physiological systems show the elements of chaotic\r\nbehavior, i.e. irregularity and chaotic dynamics are the extremely important\r\ncharacteristics of health. Decrease in changeability and appearance of stable periodicity\r\nof Autowave reverberator are often connected with Autism.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose is to study brain plasticity (the changes that occur in the brain\r\nthrough Autowave reverberator) in children with autism. Research suggests that during\r\ndevelopment, the brains of children may change in response to their Autowave reverberator\r\ndifferently than the brains of typically developing individuals.

Fetal exposure to drugs that bind to central nervous system\r\ntargets as part of their therapeutic effect (e.g. neurotransmitter receptors and neuronal\r\nchannels) appear to alter brain structure and function in both animal models and humans.\r\n\r\nFetal magnetic resonance imaging offers an approach to investigate these effects in vivo,\r\nidentifying biomarkers, defining the onset of abnormalities and dose response. Fetal MRI\r\nmay offer risk stratification and identify patients that may benefit from intervention\r\nearly in development. The overall aim of this study is to contribute to improving\r\ndevelopmental outcomes following the inevitable exposure during treatment of maternal\r\nepilepsy.\r\n\r\nThis novel study aims to explore the central nervous system with state-of-the-art\r\nnon-invasive multimodal magnetic resonance imaging consistent with the University of\r\nNottingham Precision Imaging Beacon, so as to improve outcomes in patients at risk of\r\nlong term complex neuropsychiatric conditions.",

    "title": "Pragmatic Abilities in Children With Acquired Brain Injury",
    "description": "Although neuroplasticity of the brain is high in childhood, some neuropsychological\r\nsequelae could persist over the long term in children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).\r\nMany children with TBI, show deficits in pragmatic abilities that usually persist.\r\nPragmatic difficulties have been observed also in children with sequelae of brain\r\nneoplasms .\r\n\r\nThe lack of validated assessment tools for this population is described in literature.\r\nThis limit is also valid for the tests that assess pragmatic abilities. The tests that\r\nSLPs usually administer investigate only the comprehension of verbal pragmatic and,\r\nsometimes the comprehension of linguistic and emotional prosody as well. This could lead\r\nto the risk that, sometimes, some pragmatic abilities might not be included in the\r\nevaluation. Moreover, it leads to a harder definition of the treatment aims and a harder\r\nobjective demonstration of treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is important to use an assessment tool that provides information on\r\nall the pragmatic abilities, not only in input but also in output. Some Italian\r\nresearchers, recently, developed a test that investigates all these areas. It is called\r\n\"ABaCo\", and it is based on the Cognitive Pragmatics Theory. This theory is focused on\r\ncognitive processes underlying human communication.\r\n\r\nThis test is standardized on a normative group of 300 adults. It was developed with the\r\naim of assessing pragmatic abilities in adults with brain injuries. The assessor shows\r\nshort videos to the patient, and he/her has to complete or understand the interaction\r\ntransmitted through different communication channels. The authors also created an\r\nadaptation of this test for children aged 5 to 8.6 years old, modifying some items. After\r\nthat, they administered this adaptation of the test to 390 healthy children. In another\r\nstudy, the authors administered this version of the batteries to children with autism\r\nspectrum disorders and to a control group of healthy children, matched by age and sex.\r\n\r\nConsidering all the studies that already exist for the application of this assessment\r\ntool in childhood and adolescence, and the perspective of a standardization for\r\ndevelopmental ages, this study aims to investigate whether this test could be useful to\r\ndetect pragmatic difficulties also in children with ABI.",

The observation will entail taking a\r\n     verbatim language sample if needed and discussing the decision about whether the\r\n     child meets this verbal fluency criteria with a study supervisor if needed. The data\r\n     collectors will be at least high school graduates and over the age of 18 and be\r\n     trained in assessing fluency level through parent interview and observation. They\r\n     will also be trained to understand the presentation of individuals with ASD, as well\r\n     as in how to respond if the child is noncompliant or presents with suicidal thoughts\r\n     and behaviors.\r\n\r\n  -  Age 8 years to 17.\r\n\r\n  -  English speaking child and parent; may use an Augmentative and Alternative\r\n     Communication (AAC) device to assist.\r\n\r\n  -  A legal guardian must provide permission and participant must sign an assent\r\n     document or provide verbal assent.\r\n\r\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n\r\nAn individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation\r\nin this study:\r\n\r\n  -  The parent or the legal guardian is unavailable/unwilling to sign consent.\r\n\r\n  -  The participant will not have prisoner status, e.g. not on probation or house arrest\r\n\r\nINCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:\r\n\r\n-Children: Children and adolescents with ASD/NDD are the focus of the study due to the\r\nlack of suicide risk screening tools available for this general population. Clients who\r\ndo not speak English will be excluded from the study. Unfortunately, the screening tools\r\nthat will be utilized in this study are not available at this time in any other languages\r\nbesides English.\r\n\r\nOTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS:\r\n\r\nThe study sites include health clinic or psychiatric units that serve children,\r\nadolescents or adults with ASD/NDD. Currently these sites service suicidal individuals\r\nand no validated instrument with which to assess these vulnerable individuals.",

    "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterised by an impairment of social interactions\r\nand communication, associated with repetitive behaviour and restrictive interests.\r\nClinical phenotypes of this neurodevelopmental disorder are heterogeneous and\r\nsurprisingly up to 70% of ASD patients have gastro-intestinal (GI) disorders, associated\r\nwith ASD severity and influence by feeding disorders.\r\n\r\nGut-brain axis seems to play a key role in neurodevelopment and ASD pathophysiology.\r\nIndeed an intestinal dysbiosis is observed in ASD, as well as intestinal inflammation and\r\npermeability. Aspecific inflammatory pattern suggests neuroinflammation processes in ASD.\r\nNeuroinflammation is involved in blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity and there are some\r\narguments for a putative BBBimpairment in ASD. Nevertheless, no study has explored all\r\ntogether these parameters in ASD patients.\r\n\r\nHere we hypothesise that intestinal dysbiosis in ASD could lead to a BBB impairment\r\nthrough neuroinflammation processes. Furthermore, this association between intestinal\r\ndysbiosis and BBB impairment could be influenced by a lot of clinical characteristics,\r\nsuch as ASD severity or GI disorders presence.\r\n\r\nThe principal aim of our study is to determine if the gut microbiota composition is\r\nassociated with the BBB integrity in ASD. The secondary objectives are i) too identify in\r\nchildren with ASD some physiopathological pathways involved in this association, with a\r\nfocus on associations betweenintestinal dysbiosis, intestinal permeability, intestinal\r\npermeability, the Th1/Th2 immune response, neuroinflammation and the BBB integrity; ii)\r\nto evaluate the influence of these associations on several clinical features of ASD such\r\nas ASD severity or GI disorders intensity; iii) to evaluate the influence of nutritional\r\nstatus on biological and clinical parameters.\r\n\r\nThis study will assess a lot of clinical and biological parameters together, some of them\r\nwere never explored in ASD children. It will allow to better understand ASD\r\npathophysiology, to highlight new therapeutic pathway, and to promote personalised\r\nmedicine.",

    "title": "Telehealth Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder",
    "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most frequently occurring childhood-onset\r\nneurodevelopmental disorders affecting 1 in every 54 children. Most children with ASD\r\nexperience challenges participating in daily activities (e.g.: eating, sleeping, bathing,\r\ngrooming, playing, etc.) and receive occupational therapy intervention to address these.\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has restricted in-person therapy for many of these children and\r\nthere is an urgent need for evidence-based, validated telehealth intervention. This\r\nproject will adapt an evidence-based occupational therapy intervention, termed OT4ASD to\r\na telehealth delivery model. The aims of the project are to: 1) adapt the existing\r\nintervention protocol to a telehealth delivery model, 2) train therapists and evaluate\r\nthe therapist's ability to conduct OT4ASD, 3) determine if OT4ASD delivered via the\r\ntelehealth is acceptable and feasible to parents and interventionists; and 4) whether\r\nchildren improve in the daily living skills. OT4ASD follows a systematic protocol and\r\nuses active, individually-tailored sensory motor activities that are specifically\r\ndesigned to address the child's needs. The investigators believe this will be the first\r\ntelehealth manualized protocol to address the sensory motor symptoms of ASD and measure\r\noutcomes at the daily life activity and participation levels.",

    "title": "The Neural Coding of Speech Across Human Languages",
    "description": "The overall goal of this study is to reveal the fundamental neural mechanisms that\r\nunderlie comprehension across human spoken languages. An understanding of how speech is\r\ncoded in the brain has significant implications for the development of new diagnostic and\r\nrehabilitative strategies for language disorders (e.g. aphasia, dyslexia, autism, et\r\nalia). The basic mechanisms underlying comprehension of spoken language are unknown.\r\nResearchers are only beginning to understand how the human brain extracts the most\r\nfundamental linguistic elements (consonants and vowels) from a complex and highly\r\nvariable acoustic signal. Traditional theories have posited a 'universal' phonetic\r\ninventory shared by all humans, but this has been challenged by other newer theories that\r\neach language has its own unique and specialized code. An investigation of the cortical\r\nrepresentation of speech sounds across languages can likely shed light on this\r\nfundamental question. Previous research has implicated the superior temporal cortex in\r\nthe processing of speech sounds. Most of this work has been entirely carried out in\r\nEnglish. The recording of neural activity directly from the cortical surface from\r\nindividuals with different language experience is a promising approach since it can\r\nprovide both high spatial and temporal resolution. This study will examine the mechanisms\r\nof phonetic encoding, by utilizing neurophysiological recordings obtained during\r\nneurosurgical procedures. High-density electrode arrays, advanced signal processing, and\r\ndirect electrocortical stimulation will be utilized to unravel both local and population\r\nencoding of speech sounds in the lateral temporal cortex. This study will also examine\r\nthe neural encoding of speech in patients who are monolingual and bilingual in Mandarin,\r\nSpanish, and English, the most common spoken languages worldwide, and feature important\r\ncontrastive differences of pitch, formant, and temporal envelope. A cross-linguistic\r\napproach is critical for a true understanding of language, while also striving to achieve\r\na broader approach of diversity and inclusion in neuroscience of language.",

    "title": "A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting TDCS Treatment Outcomes of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders",
    "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by\r\ndisturbances in communication, poor social skills, and aberrant behaviors. Particularly\r\ndetrimental are the presence of restricted and repetitive stereotyped behaviors and\r\nuncontrollable temper outbursts over trivial changes in the environment, which often\r\ncause emotional stress for the children, their families, schools and neighborhood\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nFundamental to these cognitive and behavioral problems is the disordered cortical\r\nconnectivity and resultant executive dysfunction that underpin the use of effective\r\nstrategies to integrate information across contexts. Brain connectivity problems affect\r\nthe rate at which information travels across the brain. Slow processing speed relates to\r\na reduced capacity of executive function to recall and formulate thoughts and actions\r\nautomatically, with the result that autistic children with poor processing speed have\r\ngreat difficulty learning or perceiving relationships across multiple experiences. In\r\nconsequence, these children compensate for the impaired ability to integrate information\r\nfrom the environment by memorizing visual details or individual rules from each\r\nsituation. This explains why children with autism tend to follow routines in precise\r\ndetail and show great distress over seemingly trivial changes in the environment.\r\n\r\nTo date, there is no known cure for ASD, and the disorder remains a highly disabling\r\ncondition. Recently, a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, transcranial direct\r\ncurrent Stimulation (tDCS) has shown great promise as a potentially effective and\r\ncosteffective tool for reducing core symptoms such as anxiety, aggression, impulsivity,\r\nand inattention in patients with autism. This technique has been shown to modify behavior\r\nby inducing changes in cortical excitability and enhancing connectivity between the\r\ntargeted brain areas. However, not all ASD patients respond to this intervention the same\r\nway and predicting the behavioral impact of tDCS in patients with ASD remains a clinical\r\nchallenge.

    "title": "Biomarker-Driven Pharmacological Treatment of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder with Gabapentin",
    "description": "The social cognitive deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are related\r\nto an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, specifically a deficit in\r\nthe inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The investigators have used magnetic resonance\r\nspectroscopy (MRS) techniques to measure GABA in specific brain regions and have\r\ndemonstrated that a single dose of gabapentin increases GABA in brain regions associated\r\nwith social cognition. This study will use a biomarker-driven approach to investigate\r\ngabapentin to correct the underlying imbalance of neurotransmitters and improve the core\r\nsocial cognitive deficits in ASD. By using a brain-based biomarker (GABA) that is\r\nquantifiable and measurable, the investigators can target this biomarker directly and\r\nmeasure the impact of the treatment. This will help with the future development of\r\ntargeted therapies for ASD and provide an early marker of response to aid in the\r\nselection of individuals more likely to respond to various treatments. The specific aims\r\nof this study are to: 1) determine if treatment with gabapentin sustainably increases\r\nGABA in the right anterior insula (RAI; an area of the brain involved in social\r\ncognition), 2) determine if response of RAI GABA levels to a single dose challenge of\r\ngabapentin predicts a sustained response after treatment, and 3) determine if the\r\nincrease in GABA levels with gabapentin treatment translates into clinically measurable\r\nimprovement in social cognition. The investigators will conduct an 8-week open-label\r\nclinical trial of gabapentin in 40 adolescents (age 13-17 years) with ASD, using MRS\r\nbefore and after treatment to measure GABA in the RAI (the primary outcome for the\r\nstudy). Before the trial, a single dose challenge of gabapentin will be used to evaluate\r\nthe immediate response of GABA levels in the RAI, to determine if this predicts later\r\nresponse. A secondary outcome will be the clinical effects of gabapentin on social\r\ncognition. This study can demonstrate for the first time that neuroimaging biomarkers can\r\nbe used to guide treatment of social cognition deficits seen in ASD and that the\r\nexcitatory-inhibitory imbalance in neurotransmitters in ASD can be pharmacologically\r\ntargeted. This can provide a rational basis for pharmacological treatment of the core\r\nsocial deficits of ASD, providing direct benefit to participants in the study as well as\r\nindirect benefit to countless patients in the future.",

    "description": "Given the increasing prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), estimated to be 1 in\r\n68 in the United States alone, ASD has become one of the fastest-growing pediatric\r\nconcerns. The deficits of children with ASD range across social communication and\r\nacademic skills. One of the effective interventions that have been used commonly for ASD\r\nis the model-lead-test, which includes modeling, prompting children to practice target\r\nskills together, and providing children with affirmative feedback or error correction.\r\nPrevious research has demonstrated that the model-lead-test is successful in teaching\r\ndifferent skills for individuals with ASD, including functional, social, and academic\r\nskills. The vast majority of the studies had researchers, therapists, or teachers\r\nimplement the intervention. However, there is clear empirical support and implications\r\nfor interventions mediated by more familiar persons, such as parents and siblings, which\r\nmay lead to better effects, maintenance, and generalization due to more practice\r\nopportunities in the natural environments. Research has supported the effectiveness of\r\nusing parents or peers as agents to deliver interventions for individuals with ASD,\r\nwhereas fewer studies explored the use of siblings to deliver or mediate intervention. As\r\ntypically developing siblings are an essential part of the daily life of children with\r\nASD, it makes logical extensions to have siblings as mediators to deliver interventions.\r\n\r\nIn the initial findings, the investigators found the typically developing siblings can\r\naccurately implement the model-lead-test procedure that improved various skills of their\r\nsiblings with ASD. This project will extend these findings by examining the efficacy of\r\nthe sibling-implemented intervention on early literacy (reading) and social reciprocity\r\n(conversation and play) of children with ASD as well as the sibling relationship before,\r\nduring, and after the intervention.",

    "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a neurodevelopmental disorder. Their prevalence is\r\nestimated at around 0.4% of the general population worldwide. Their early onset and\r\nchronic nature make them a disabling disorder, all the more so as there is a high\r\nprevalence of sleep disorders in these populations, estimated at between 50 and 80%, with\r\nmany complaints of insomnia in particular. These sleep disorders may result from\r\nbiological, psychological, social, environmental and family factors.\r\n\r\nSmith Magenis Syndrome (SMS) is a complex disorder characterized by severe neurological,\r\npsychological and behavioral disorders including sleep-wake rhythm disorders. It is a\r\nrare disease with a prevalence of 1/25 000.\r\n\r\nThese sleep disorders observed could be the consequence of a general dysregulation of the\r\ncircadian system, since SMS patients show an inversion of the melatonin secretion profile\r\n(with a totally abnormal diurnal peak) and in patients with autism spectrum disorders, an\r\noverall reduction in melatonin secretion.\r\n\r\nThese sleep-wake disturbances cycle could play a significant role in learning deficits\r\nand in the frequency and severity of behavioral abnormalities observed in SMS and ASD.\r\n\r\nIn this project, investigators propose to study the mechanisms involved in the sleep-wake\r\ncycle disorders observed in Smith Magenis and Autism Spectrum children, in particular by\r\nevaluating the quality of the pupillary reflex using a pupillometer.

    "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects\r\nthe functioning and development of social communication (DSM5 - 2013). ASD causes\r\nparticularities in sensory treatments (auditory, visual), qualified as uni-modal. Added\r\nto this, there is difficulties to deal with prevailing stimuli of the environment\r\n(pluri-modal) ; parents report the discomfort of their child in this situation with\r\n\"noisy\" behavioral manifestations. Therapeutic social skills programs most often address\r\nthe subject's lack of adjustment to their environment through understanding social rules\r\nand codes and cognitive treatment of situations.\r\n\r\nThus, in order to relieve the sensory modulation disorders which can be the cause of\r\nsocial adjustment difficulties, it's propose to exercise the sensory habituation of\r\nchildren with ASD thanks to virtual reality scenarios restored in 3D immersion booth (the\r\nCAVE). The child will be exposed to multimodal stimulation during immersion sessions\r\nreproducing the conditions of an ecological environment. A therapist will accompany the\r\nchild in the CAVE throughout the session.\r\n\r\nThe investigators hypothesize that regular and repeated exposure to a simulated\r\nenvironment in the CAVE can improve multisensory treatment capacities and have a\r\nbeneficial effect on the autonomy of children and adolescents with ASD in everyday\r\nsituations.",

    "title": "Neural Basis of Social Cognition Deficits",
    "description": "Difficulties in reciprocal social interaction are hallmark features of several\r\nneuropsychiatric disorders, most notably autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia\r\nspectrum disorder (SSD). While recent studies have demonstrated substantial overlap in\r\ngenetic etiology between ASD and SSD, little is known about common versus unique neural\r\nmechanisms that may underlie these downstream social deficits that cross diagnostic\r\nboundaries. Thus, a comprehensive imaging study examining social deficits in youth with\r\nASD and adolescent- onset SSD at the neurochemical, connectivity, as well as functional\r\nactivation level will be crucial in furthering our understanding of these underlying\r\nneural mechanisms. Specifically, the current project aims to examine how targeted social\r\nskills interventions may impact the organization of large-scale functional brain networks\r\nimplicated in social cognition in these disorders, leading to improved outcomes. Thirty\r\nadolescents with ASD and 30 adolescents with SSD will undergo the Program for the\r\nEducation and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS), which is a 16-week parent-assisted\r\nsocial skills intervention that aims to improve friendship quality and social skills in\r\nteens with social difficulties. All participants will receive pre- and post-treatment MRI\r\nscans including functional MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify neural\r\nchanges resulting from the intervention. All participants will also receive behavioral\r\nand social cognition assessments pre- and post-intervention to quantify real- world gains\r\nin social behaviors resulting from the intervention. Additionally, 30 typically\r\ndeveloping adolescents will be recruited to serve as control participants and undergo two\r\nMRI and behavioral assessment sessions 16-weeks apart with no intervention in between.\r\nSpecific aims include (1) examining inter-group disruptions in connectivity patterns,\r\nactivation levels, and neurometabolite concentrations in key social brain regions\r\npre-treatment in ASD and SSD groups, (2) examining inter-group changes in connectivity\r\npatterns, activation levels, and neurometabolite concentrations in key social brain\r\nregions in response to treatment in ASD and SSD groups, and, (3) dimensionally\r\nidentifying intra-group differences in brain responses and how they relate to real-world\r\ntreatment outcomes.",
    "eligibility": "Inclusion Criteria:\r\n\r\nParticipants in this study will be 30 ASD adolescents and 30 demographically matched\r\nadolescents with SSD who undergo the PEERS social skills training program. Participants\r\nwill be between the ages of 12-18 years, and mostly male reflecting the higher prevalence\r\nin the population of ASD, and to a lesser extent, SSD. The ASD adolescents will be\r\nrecruited through the Loma Linda University Behavioral Health Institute (LLU BHI), LLU\r\nBehavior Medicine Center (BMC), and LLU Department of Psychology Child and Family Center\r\n(CFC). The SSD adolescents will be recruited from the BMC inpatient, partial\r\nhospitalization, intensive outpatient, and standard outpatient programs for youth with\r\npsychosis. Thirty demographically comparable typically developing (TD) controls will be\r\nrecruited through community samples, and in compliance with the LLU Institutional Review\r\nBoard (IRB) standards. Before enrolling in the proposed MRI studies, prospective ASD\r\nparticipants will undergo testing with experienced assessors. Clinical diagnosis will be\r\nconfirmed using both the Autism Diagnostic Interview- Revised, and the Autism Diagnostic\r\nObservation Schedule, 2nd edition. SSD participants will be screened using the Structured\r\nClinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) Axis I diagnoses, with additional modules for\r\nassessment of childhood disorders. SSD participants must meet criteria for schizophrenia,\r\nschizophreniform, schizoaffective disorder, or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and\r\nother psychotic disorder.

The lifelong challenging and disruptive\r\nbehaviors often associated with ASD requires caregivers to change their behavior and\r\nmodify their environments to provide an ecosystem for optimal outcomes for their child,\r\nfamily and themselves. ASD behaviors can have significant impact on caregivers mental\r\nhealth and family functioning, including the ability to develop and maintain healthy\r\nsleep routines. The caregiving population in US has a high prevalence of insomnia; two\r\nthirds of caregivers experiencing difficulties falling and/or staying asleep. The\r\nprevalence of insomnia in children with ASD is equally high, 60-80% experiencing night\r\nwaking contributing to poor daytime behavior and disrupted sleep in the caregivers. This\r\npilot RCT will focus on improving caregivers sleep in the context of caring for a child\r\nwith ASD and insomnia with a multi-disciplinary team.

This platform-Early Social Interaction Mobile Coaching (ESI-MC) deploys\r\nindividual telehealth sessions with coaching and feedback to help families embed\r\nintervention in everyday activities. Specifically, the investigators will conduct an\r\neffectiveness trial of ESI-MC to address the important question of whether starting\r\nevidence-based intervention earlier leads to better outcomes than starting later. The\r\ninvestigators will address this question by using a modified stepped wedge design and\r\nblended implementation research to analyze data obtained with ESI-MC start at 18, 24, or\r\n30 months. The investigators will diagnostically ascertain 240 children from a pool of\r\n360 18-month-olds with early signs of autism, 30 in each of 8 US regions (Central and SW\r\nFlorida; Atlanta, GA; suburbs of Philadelphia, PA; New York City, NY; Cincinnati, OH;\r\nChicago, IL; Seattle, WA; and Los Angeles, CA). Research participants will be recruited\r\nusing a new virtual platform-My Baby Navigator-linking a new surveillance and screening\r\ntool, an app to upload video-recorded home observations and telehealth intervention\r\nsessions, and a package of educational resources. The 240 children will be randomly\r\nassigned to one of three ESI-MC timing groups.

    "title": "Cumulative and Booster Effects of Multisession Prefrontal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Adolescents with ASD",
    "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive and lifelong developmental disorder that\r\ncurrently affects 1 in 54 children. Individuals with autism are often severely impaired\r\nin communication, social skills, and cognitive functions. Particularly detrimental\r\ncharacteristics typical of ASD include the inability to relate to people and the display\r\nof repetitive stereotyped behaviors and uncontrollable temper outbursts over trivial\r\nchanges in the environment, which often cause emotional stress for the children, their\r\nfamilies, schools and neighborhood communities. To date, there is no cure for ASD, and\r\nthe disorder remains a highly disabling condition. Recently, transcranial direct current\r\nstimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive neuromodulation technique, has shown great promise as\r\nan effective and cost-effective tool for reducing core symptoms, such as anxiety,\r\naggression, impulsivity, and poor social communication, in patients with autism. Although\r\nthe empirical findings in patients with ASD are encouraging, it remains to be determined\r\nwhether these experimental data can be translated into real-world benefits. An important\r\nnext step is to better understand the factors affecting the long-term efficacy of tDCS\r\ntreatment - in particular, the possible risk factors associated with relapse in patients\r\nwith ASD and the role of booster session tDCS as an add-on treatment to induce\r\nlong-lasting neuroplastic effects in ASD.",

    "title": "Brain and Oculometric Markers of Emotional Facial Expression Recognition Deficits",
    "description": "Disorders in the recognition of emotional facial expressions are part of the social\r\ncognition disorders described in several diseases. They are notably present in a\r\nquasi-systematic way in diseases associated with socio-emotional behavior disorders, such\r\nas schizophrenia and autism. They are also found in some genetic syndromes with atypical\r\nneurodevelopment. In previous studies, the investigators adopted the FPVS-EEG approach to\r\ninvestigate facial emotion discrimination abilities in typical and atypical developing\r\npopulations. the investigatorshave shown that, in typical adults, the neural response to\r\nfacial expressions emerges as emotional intensity parametrically increases. A time-domain\r\nanalysis revealed three components, with the first two increasing linearly with\r\nexpressive intensity, and the third (beyond 300 ms) showing categorical sensitivity to\r\nincreasing expressive intensity. The investigators have already successfully extended\r\nthis approach to the investigation of patients, such as those with 22q11.2 syndrome. The\r\nbrain response to facial expression was reduced by approximately 36% in these patients,\r\nrevealing impaired visual coding of emotional facial signals. In this study, response\r\namplitude was associated with positive symptom severity, indicating a potential\r\nendophenotype for psychosis risk. Here, the investigators study the implementation of\r\nhigh-level processes and the top-down effect it should have on the response of\r\noccipitotemporal regions to identify altered brain markers in schizophrenic patients, but\r\nalso in other populations with expression recognition deficits (autistic, 22q11.2, in\r\nparticular). The implementation of compensatory strategies that should result in an\r\nincreased exploration of the lower part of the face at the oculometric level will also be\r\nstudied.",

However, until now, all studies are based on declarative\r\nparadigms, and no one has proposed to examine the relationship of people with ASD to\r\nmoral transgressions (i.e. to a bad action done deliberately or to a good deed\r\ndeliberately omitted) in an implicit paradigm, that is, when the answer is made on the\r\nassignment of an expressive face to these moral offenses. Furthermore, no study has\r\ninvestigated whether diminished sensitivity to intention and intransigence of incidental\r\njudgment occur in both automatic (implicit) and deliberative (explicit) settings.\r\n\r\nInvestigators planned to study how people with ASD without intellectual disability\r\nprocess emotions expressed by others in response to different forms of moral offense and\r\nto examine whether patterns potentially contrast in degree and/or kind with those of\r\nneurotypicals.",

    "title": "Work Chat: An Interactive Virtual Workday",
    "description": "Nearly 50,000 youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) transition from high school to\r\nadult life each year with only 25% of these transition-age youth with ASD (TAY-ASD)\r\ngetting jobs within 2 years of graduation. TAY-ASD's ability to sustain employment is\r\neven more challenging due in part to their social cognitive deficits (e.g., poorly\r\nreading social cues) that disrupt communicating with customers, coworkers, and\r\nsupervisors. Research shows nearly 90% of job dismissals among TAY-ASD are attributed to\r\npoor work-based social functioning (e.g., poorly communicating with upset customers). The\r\nsubsequent unemployment has damaging effects on their mental, physical, and economic\r\nhealth. A critical gap in federally-mandated services to support youth with ASD as they\r\ntransition from school-to-adult life is the lack of evidence-based practice to enhance\r\nwork-based social functioning. Given that TAY-ASD report computerized training tools\r\n(developed by the investigators and others) are highly acceptable and improve their\r\nreal-world outcomes, the investigators propose to address this critical barrier to\r\nsustained employment by developing and evaluating a novel and scalable computerized\r\ntraining tool to enhance participant conversations with customers, coworkers and\r\nsupervisors at work.\r\n\r\nThe investigators propose to develop and test the effectiveness of Social Cognitive and\r\nAffective Learning for Work (Work Chat: An Interactive Virtual Workday), a computerized\r\ntraining tool. Work Chat will have three tiers of instruction designed to help TAY-ASD\r\nprepare for effective workplace communication. Tier 1 will adapt existing evidence-based\r\npractices to design an e-learning curriculum that trains social cognitive strategies to\r\nhelp guide work-related conversations (e.g., reading social cues or regulating emotions\r\nduring supervisor feedback). In Tier 2, SIMmersion's PeopleSim\u00ae technology will enable\r\nTAY-ASD to apply social cognitive strategies learned in Tier 1 to repetitively practice\r\nsimulated conversations with a fictional customer, coworker, or supervisor. In Tier 3,\r\nSIMmersion will innovate PeopleSim to exist in an interactive 3-D environment to create a\r\nvirtual workday with interconnected activities were the actions made early in the day\r\ninfluence conversations later in the day (e.g., a poor customer interaction may result in\r\nconstructive feedback from a supervisor).\r\n\r\nPhase I (Feasibility) was completed with application HUM00177878.\r\n\r\nPhase II (Efficacy) Aims:\r\n\r\nAim 1) Complete Work Chat development using an iterative process that includes initial\r\nand ongoing individual-level feedback from Phase I participants and the community and\r\nscientific advisory boards to complete the product that will be evaluated in Aims 2-3.\r\n\r\nAim 2) Conduct a Randomized Controlled Effectiveness-Implementation hybrid trial in a\r\nschool setting to evaluate Work Chat. The investigators will recruit and randomly assign\r\nn=338 TAY-ASD (90% of sample frame) enrolled in school-based standard transition services\r\n(STS) to the Work Chat group (STS+SW) or a STS group (STS). The hypothesis is that\r\nSTS+SW, compared to STS, will show greater gains in: (H1) social cognition and (H2)\r\nwork-based social functioning; as well as (H3) reduced anxiety about work-based social\r\nencounters, and (H4) greater sustained employment by 9-month follow-up. The investigators\r\nwill test mechanistic hypotheses (H5a-b) that social cognitive ability (H5a) and\r\nwork-based social functioning (H5b) mediate the effect of treatment (STS+SW vs. STS) on\r\nsustained employment. For the implementation evaluation, the investigators will conduct a\r\nmultilevel, mixed-method process evaluation of Work Chat's acceptability,\r\nappropriateness, and feasibility.\r\n\r\nAim 3) Use community participatory research methods to prepare for commercialization. The\r\ninvestigators will conduct a parallel multilevel, mixed method implementation evaluation\r\nthat focuses on the Work Chat delivery system regarding its feasibility, sustainability,\r\nscalability, and generalizability by conduct focus groups with delivery staff and\r\nadministrators. These groups will discuss potential facilitators and barriers to Work\r\nChat implementation, adoption, and sustainability.",

    "title": "Characterization of Dysmorphology in Subjects With Creatine Transporter Deficiency",
    "description": "Background:\r\n\r\nCreatine transporter deficiency (CTD) is a genetic disorder that mainly affects the brain\r\nin males. CTD causes intellectual disability that can be mild to severe. People with CTD\r\nmay have seizures and behavioral issues. They may have slow growth and tire easily. CTD\r\nmay sometimes be confused with autism or other disorders. Better diagnostics are needed.\r\nThe study team in an NIH study noted that the faces of children with CTD can look\r\nsimilar. For this natural history study, an expert will examine photos of children with\r\nCTD. Any shared traits found might help to diagnose CTD.\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\n\r\nTo look for shared facial features of children with CTD.\r\n\r\nEligibility: Males aged 2 to 40 years old with CTD who were in study 17-CH-0020.\r\n\r\nDesign:\r\n\r\nSome participants in study 17-CH-0020 had pictures taken of their faces. The NIH study\r\nteam wants to share these photos with a colleague in Canada. This person is an expert at\r\nevaluating how genetic disorders affect people s bodies.\r\n\r\nParticipant data collected during the study may also be sent to this expert. This data\r\nmay include diagnostic images and results from lab tests.\r\n\r\nSome children did not have their pictures taken during study 17-CH-0020. Parents are\r\nasked to take pictures of these children and send them to the study team. These photos\r\ncan be sent to a secure portal. The photos can also be taken in-person during a clinic\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nThe photos may be printed in clinical study journals. But this is not required. Parents\r\nwill be asked to sign a separate consent before the photos are published....",

    "description": "Sleep disturbances and sensory sensitivities are common disabling features of autism, but\r\ntheir underlying causes are not clear. We hypothesize that both of these difficulties\r\nreflect disrupted communication between a deep brain structure, the thalamus, and the\r\nbrain's outer layer, the cortex. This communication is mediated by the thalamic reticular\r\nnucleus (TRN). Due to its small size and location deep in the brain, we cannot assess TRN\r\nfunction without invasive techniques. Fortunately, sleep spindles, a specific brain\r\nrhythm provide a noninvasive read-out of TRN function. In Aim 1 we will examine whether\r\nreduced sleep spindles are related to worse sleep quality, impaired selective attention\r\nduring wake, and sensory sensitivities in children with autism. In Aim 2, we will\r\ndetermine whether melatonin, which is commonly used to improve sleep, also increases\r\nsleep spindles in autism. If successful, this study will introduce TRN as a target for\r\ntreatment of sleep disruption and guide larger home-based sleep studies.",

    "description": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are disabling and impairing conditions affecting 1% of\r\nchildren in Norway. ASD is hallmarked by severe social deficit and lack of independence\r\ncausing reliance on supportive systems throughout life. Parents are usually the primary\r\ncaretakers and support, often throughout life. Normal parenting skills are however often\r\nineffective due to the social dysfunction of the child with ASD. This causes high stress\r\nas the demands exceed the resources and capability of the parent. The high stress is\r\nassociated to increased risk for mental health problems, divorce, unemployment and\r\nreduced quality of life. High parent stress may also reduce the effect of interventions\r\nin ASD.

    "title": "Motivational Refinements for Facilitating Reinforcement Schedule Thinning",
    "description": "Destructive behavior represents a comorbid condition of developmental disability for\r\nwhich risk increases with intellectual disability severity, communication deficits, and\r\nco-occurring autism spectrum disorder. Destructive behavior, such as self-injurious\r\nbehavior and aggression, causes harm to the child and others and increases the risk for\r\ninstitutionalization, social isolation, physical restraint, medication overuse, and\r\nabuse. Clinicians have used functional analyses to identify the variables that reinforce\r\ndestructive behavior and to develop effective, function-based treatments. Functional\r\ncommunication training (FCT) is an empirically supported, function-based treatment that\r\ndecreases destructive behavior. Using FCT, the clinician teaches the child to use a\r\nfunctional communication response (FCR) to request the reinforcer maintaining destructive\r\nbehavior, while placing destructive behavior on extinction. For example, if functional\r\nanalysis results showed that attention reinforced destructive behavior, the clinician\r\nwould provide attention when the child used the FCR (\"Play with me, please\") and would\r\nnot provide attention for destructive behavior. Two limitations of FCT are that (a)\r\nschedules of reinforcement maintaining the FCR must often be thinned gradually to levels\r\nthat are practical for caregivers to implement consistently in the home and in the\r\ncommunity, and (b) this necessary process of reinforcement schedule thinning regularly\r\ncauses destructive behavior to increase following initially effective treatment, a form\r\nof treatment relapse called resurgence. The current project aims to improve these\r\nlimitations of FCT by (a) hastening the process of reinforcement schedule thinning by\r\nremoving unnecessary schedule-thinning steps using the results of a progressive interval\r\nassessment and (b) mitigating the resurgence of destructive behavior by providing stimuli\r\nthat highly compete with the reinforcer maintaining destructive behavior. The\r\ninvestigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the extent to which\r\nthese two promising refinements to FCT improve the process of reinforcement schedule\r\nthinning, and an exploratory experiment will examine the interactive effects of these two\r\napproaches. This novel project has the potential to substantially improve standards of\r\ncare guiding the treatment of severe destructive behavior and to improve the long-term\r\noutcomes for children and families afflicted by these debilitating behavior disorders.",

Despite the high incidence, in Italy it is estimated\r\nthat 1 in 77 children (age 7-9 years) (Narzisi et al., 2018), the diagnosis and the\r\nchoice of rehabilitation treatment for patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are\r\nstill based on clinical observation.

    "title": "Peer Interventions for Preschoolers With Autism",
    "description": "This proposal will evaluate a series of peer-mediated interventions (PMIs) for preschool\r\nchildren (3 to 6 years) with ASD and limited or no spoken language, using an innovative\r\nSequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design. Available evidence\r\nsupports the beneficial effects of PMIs for improving social communication in children\r\nwith ASD. Peer-related social competence is vital to a wide range of child outcomes, such\r\nas improved communication and fewer behavioral problems. Unfortunately, approximately 30%\r\nof children with ASD remain minimally-verbal in kindergarten, restricting participation\r\nin inclusive activities. Recent studies report improved communication after a\r\nspeech-generating device (SGD) is included in treatment. Effective interventions that can\r\nbe modified is necessary to ensure optimal communication outcomes when children do not\r\nmake anticipated progress. A strength of the study is that these interventions can be\r\nadopted by community-based, early service providers. All participants will receive an\r\nadapted Stay-Play-Talk (SPT) peer-mediated intervention that varies in active\r\ningredients. With SMART designs, it is possible to test and identify alternative\r\ncombinations of PMI approaches, such as the addition of a SGD. In this study, 132\r\npreschoolers with ASD (and N=264 peers without disabilities) will be initially randomized\r\nto SPT and SGD with spoken peer input only (SPT Basic; peers taught to model language) or\r\nSPT and SGD with augmented peer input (SPT Plus; peers taught to use verbal language\r\nmodels concurrently with the SGD). Each child's response to treatment after 5 weeks will\r\ndetermine that child's next phase in the SMART design. Children showing a positive\r\nresponse will continue in their originally assigned group; slow responders will be\r\nrandomly assigned to receive added treatment components to improve communication (either\r\nSPT Plus or SPT Advanced). SPT Advanced adds direct instruction strategies (i.e., adult\r\nprompts, reinforcers, and teaching trials) to increase child vocalizations in SGD\r\ninterventions. The use of a SMART design extends our prior work by testing the systematic\r\naddition of selected peer-mediated strategies in combination with an SGD that allows for\r\nflexible application of interventions based on child response. The investigators have\r\nassembled an outstanding team of highly qualified investigators with complementary skills\r\nin preschool assessment, language intervention, clinical trials, and statistics.",

    "description": "The goals of this clinical trial are to identify factors associated with the development\r\nof problem behavior in Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) and to develop an effective\r\nbehavioral assessment and treatment model for problem behavior in children with CdLS.\r\n\r\nThe hypotheses are as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Based on pilot data, the investigators hypothesize that individuals with CdLS will\r\n     exhibit preferences for auditory stimuli relative to other categories (e.g., visual,\r\n     tactile) of stimuli.\r\n\r\n  2. Based on pilot data, the investigators hypothesize that individuals with CdLS will\r\n     exhibit problem behavior to obtain adult attention or to escape task demands\r\n     relative to tangible and control conditions, as measured by functional analysis\r\n     results.\r\n\r\n  3. Function-based behavioral treatments will reduce problem behavior in individuals\r\n     with CdLS by 80% or greater relative to baseline rates.\r\n\r\n  4. Individuals with CdLS and problem behavior will exhibit more impaired communication,\r\n     demonstrate increased emotion dysregulation, and exhibit more severe symptoms of\r\n     Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relative to those with CdLS and no problem behavior.\r\n\r\nParticipants in the intervention group (families of children with CdLS and problem\r\nbehaviors) will be asked to complete study measures and attend 2 full days and one\r\nhalf-day of clinic services at Kennedy Krieger Institute so that the study team can\r\nprovide assessment and treatment of child problem behaviors, and then train parents to\r\napply the intervention. Participants in the control group (families of children with CdLS\r\nand no problem behavior) will be asked to complete study measures once every 3 months for\r\na 2-year period to monitor the children.\r\n\r\nThis study will improve the ability to effectively treat problem behavior is CdLS, as\r\nwell as identify key variables associated with problem behavior in CdLS which may be\r\nexamined in future studies and clinical practice to foster early intervention and\r\nprevention efforts.",

    "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment disorder characterized by impairment\r\nin social interaction, communication, and behavior, as well as sensory challenges. In\r\naddition, secondary symptoms can appear, such as gastrointestinal disorders. Gut\r\nmicrobiota has an important role in the harvest of nutrients and energy from our diet. It\r\ninfluences a wide range of metabolic, developmental, and physiological processes such as\r\nthe maintenance of the gut epithelial layer, immune system development, protection\r\nagainst pathogens, detoxification and xenobiotics degradation. The ecosystem of a healthy\r\nhuman gastrointestinal (GI) tract is mainly populated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes\r\nphyla, to a lesser extent by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, in this case the\r\nmicrobiota is in an eubiosis condition. Whether a disturbance of the microbial ecosystem\r\noccurs, gut microbiota is in a dysbiosis condition and it could lead different metabolic\r\ndisorders. The two-way communication between gut microbiota and central nervous system\r\n(CNS) affects stress response, pain perception, neurochemistry and several disorders. The\r\ngut microbiota in ASD patients revealed some peculiarities such as the high percentage of\r\nPropionibacter and Clostridium, well known for their production of pro inflammatory\r\nmetabolites, or an increment of Sutterella spp. and Ruminococcus torques, which are\r\nnegatively associated with the health of the gut. Recent studies suggest that also the\r\noral microbiota may be involved in ASD symptoms assuming the existence of a\r\n\"microbiota-oral-brain axis\". ASD patients are often suffering of several oral cavity\r\ndisorders like caries, gingivitis and periodontitis, probably due to the poor oral\r\nhygiene. These disorders are linked to a dysbiosis of the oral microbiota: the\r\ncharacterization of the ASD subjects oral microbiota showed a lower biodiversity of\r\nbacteria species and different levels of specific bacteria, comparing to the controls.\r\nSeveral studies suggest that some bacteria species invade the blood-brain barriers as\r\nwell as their metabolites, triggering inflammatory response and an alteration of the\r\nmetabolic activity in the CNS. It has been demonstrated that ASD patients have a high\r\nlevel of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the cerebrospinal fluid and an\r\nupregulation of the microglia. The oral microbiota could also affect the lower GI tract\r\nand have a significant role within the ASD-associated GI disorders and CNS inflammation",

Motivational interviewing will be used to\r\nsupport the participants. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure can be used to\r\nidentify what activities the participants are motivated to do, and to detect changes in\r\nthe participants' perception of their performance of the activity. Quality of life will\r\nbe monitored. Physical activity will be measured through the International Physical\r\nActivity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and a movement monitor (accelerometer). Study specific\r\nquestionnaires will be filled in regarding costs and background information. Data on\r\nhealth care use of the participants will retrospectively be collected and studied using\r\nthe health care database in Region Sk\u00e5ne.

For this reason, the individual management of the diabetic patient is\r\nimportant in terms of ensuring effective participation and compliance in treatment and\r\ncare. Patients must have knowledge, skills and positive attitudes in order to\r\nsuccessfully comply with diabetes treatment. Patients are in compliance with diabetes\r\ntreatment; they encounter some barriers such as medication barriers, barriers to\r\nself-monitoring, knowledge and belief barriers, barriers to diagnosis, barriers in\r\nrelations with health professionals, barriers to lifestyle change, barriers to coping\r\nwith diabetes, and barriers to getting advice and support. The American Diabetes\r\nAssociation (ADA) states that self-monitoring of blood sugar is important in ensuring\r\nglycemic control and preventing hyperglycemia and asymptomatic hypoglycemia. Reiki is\r\napplied as an alternative and complementary treatment method. Reiki application, when\r\nused together with pharmacological methods, chronic fatigue, diabetic neuropathy, pain\r\ncaused by surgery, cancer treatment, symptoms of cardiovascular diseases, emotional\r\ndisorders such as anxiety, depression, acute or chronic pain, infertility-related\r\nproblems, neurodegenerative disorders, AIDS, autism and developmental disorders, Crohn's\r\ndisease, irritable bowel syndrome, traumatic brain injury and has been shown to improve\r\nhealth problems such as fatigue.\r\n\r\nIn the literature, the effects of reiki have been examined in patient groups with\r\ndifferent chronic diseases, but no study has been found on obese individuals with Type 2\r\ndiabetes.

    "description": "Around 80% of children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Attention Deficit\r\nHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and autism are reported to have significant difficulties\r\nwith sleep. This may be a problem with settling off to sleep, waking repeatedly in the\r\nnight, or both.\r\n\r\nOften these children will be prescribed a medication called melatonin to help them sleep,\r\nbut there is no strong evidence of its effectiveness in children, the long-term side\r\neffects are not known and prescriptions for this drug cost millions of pounds a year for\r\nthe NHS. Many children continue to have persistent sleep problems despite taking\r\nmelatonin. Sleep support programmes delivered by nurses and sleep practitioners are known\r\nto be effective and to give parents and young people long-term strategies for promoting\r\nsleep without the use of medication. However, sleep support services are not universally\r\nfunded.\r\n\r\nIn this feasibility study 76 children with ADHD, autism or other neurodevelopmental\r\ndisorder who have been prescribed and have been regularly taking melatonin for at least a\r\nyear but still have severe sleep difficulties will be recruited. The investigators will\r\nhelp to improve the child's sleep with a sleep practitioner support programme and, if\r\npossible, reduce the dose of melatonin or stop it completely if it is no longer needed.\r\nUsing this design, it will be possible to test whether a programme delivered by sleep\r\npractitioners will significantly improve sleep for children using a non-medical approach\r\nand in turn improve the health and well-being of the child and family and reduce\r\nmelatonin prescribing, thereby saving NHS resources and the potential for long-term side\r\neffects. The study design will be delivered by Sheffield Children's Hospital and\r\nsupported by parent users, the Sleep Charity and Sheffield CCG.

    "description": "Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social communication,\r\nrepetitive behaviors, and social interaction. A key aspect of autism concerns executive\r\nfunctions, which are a set of cognitive processes that regulate attention, planning,\r\ninhibition, and impulse control. These functions are often impaired in children with\r\nautism, affecting their learning and daily functioning.\r\n\r\nThe present protocol aims to test the first absolute and then comparative effectiveness\r\nof two executive function development programs: the \"APISMELA\" training and the \"UNSTUCK\r\n& ON TARGET! SECOND EDITION\". Two groups will be held at the same time and will conduct\r\nthe two programs in reverse order. In fact, the protocol is divided into two phases.\r\n\r\nParticipants subjected to the APISMELA group, finished the intervention sessions will\r\nconduct an interim evaluation and then begin the intervention phases of the UNSTUCK & ON\r\nTARGET!

SECOND EDITION group, finished the\r\nintervention sessions will conduct an interim evaluation and then begin the intervention\r\nphases of the APISMELA protocol.\r\n\r\nGroup intervention programs were chosen for two reasons: group intervention compared with\r\nindividual intervention have lower costs for patients and their families and thus higher\r\noverall social acceptability. The second is that group intervention within the\r\nsocial-constructivist paradigm, to which the two chosen programs belong, becomes a\r\nfundamental resource for stimulating that augmentative learning that is a source of\r\ndevelopment on the cognitive and conceptual levels for human beings.",

    "title": "Metacognitive Therapy for Common Mental Health Problems in Autistic CYP: A Case Series",
    "description": "Anxiety and Depression are common in young people (CYP) and especially in CYP with a\r\ndiagnosis of Autism. Autistic people often say therapy has not been adapted to meet their\r\nneeds. A recent treatment called metacognitive therapy (MCT) is proving to be helpful,\r\nbut the investigators do not know how autistic CYP will find MCT, or what changes to the\r\ndelivery of therapy may be needed to meet their needs. This study hopes to explore\r\nwhether MCT can help treat anxiety and/or depression in autistic young people.\r\n\r\nThis study aims to offer five autistic CYP MCT. To take part, they must be between 11-16\r\nyears old and have depression and/or anxiety symptoms. The study will involve completing\r\nquestionnaires at the start, during therapy, at the end and after 6 months. Therapy will\r\nbe scheduled for at least eight sessions. Therapy involves working on what we think about\r\nour worry, rather than on specific worries. What we think about our worry can be positive\r\nor negative. For example, 'worrying helps me cope' and 'worrying could make me go mad'.\r\nThis can affect where our attention goes and how we think. At the end of therapy,\r\nparticipants will be asked to take part in an interview about how they found the therapy.\r\n\r\nThe questionnaires will help test how useful the measures are, suggest how helpful the\r\ntherapy might be and whether benefits continue after the therapy has ended. Information\r\nwill also be gathered through a post treatment interview about how the young people found\r\nthe therapy. This will help understand whether any changes to the therapy are needed to\r\nmeet the needs of autistic people. This information is necessary for planning a\r\nlarge-scale trial for autistic CYP. Such studies may improve treatment options and\r\nservice provision for mental health problems in this population.\r\n\r\nPrimary Question:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Is MCT a feasible and acceptable treatment for treating anxiety and depression in\r\nautistic CYP?\r\n\r\nSecondary Questions:\r\n\r\n  -  Is MCT associated with clinically significant change in outcome measures following\r\n     the introduction of treatment for autistic CYP?\r\n\r\n  -  Are improvements associated with MCT maintained at 6 month follow up?\r\n\r\n  -  Are improvements associated with MCT replicable across autistic CYP?\r\n\r\n  -  Do the investigators need to modify how MCT is delivered to autistic CYP?",

    "description": "For many affected individuals, despite impairment and distress, autism spectrum disorder\r\n(ASD) is recognized and diagnosed late, in school age, adolescence, or even in adulthood,\r\nwhich could be due, among other things, to the use of compensatory strategies such as\r\nso-called \"camouflaging\" by the respective individual. In order to better investigate and\r\nquantify these adaptive and compensatory strategies of individuals with autism, the\r\nCamouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) has recently been developed and\r\nvalidated in the English-speaking world. The CAT-Q is designed to assess the extent of\r\ncamouflaging behavior, in which autistic individuals consciously or unconsciously attempt\r\nto conceal or attenuate their autistic traits in order to better adapt to social\r\nsituations. So far, however, there is no German-language questionnaire that can be used\r\nto validly assess camouflaging. The aim of the planned research project is to\r\npsychometrically validate the CAT-Q in German-speaking adolescents aged 13-21 years. The\r\nvalidation of the CAT-Q represents an important basis for further research on the\r\nconstruct camouflaging and can subsequently contribute to an improvement of diagnostics\r\nas well as support the development of individual treatment approaches.",

It consists of\r\nsetting up an individualized, intensive program (at least 20 hours per week) through the\r\npleasure of play. The teacher follows the motivation and interests of the child, and it\r\nis the child who chooses the activities. Studies published in recent years tend to show\r\nthat robots bring benefits to ASD children, particularly in the treatment of social\r\ninteractions and in clinical settings. However, there is no scientific consensus on the\r\ngeneralized contribution and effect over time of these interventions. Moreover, a robotic\r\nsolution controlled by a practitioner through a telepresence system allows for a better\r\nadaptability to the responses and desires of the children during the interventions.

The most famous are stereotypies (found in autism),\r\ncompulsions (found in obsessive-compulsive-disorder, OCD) and tics (found in Gilles de la\r\nTourette syndrome, GTS). For some patients, it is sometime difficult to distinguish the\r\nnature of the repetitive behaviors presented, however this distinction is crucial in\r\norder to chose the appropriate treatment.\r\n\r\nAim:\r\n\r\nIn our study, the investigators will try to define electrophysiological and\r\naccelerometric marker of both OCD and tics to allow objective distinction between both\r\ntics and compulsions.\r\n\r\nMethod:\r\n\r\nSubjects: Both OCD and GTS patients will be recruited, 25 patients in each group.\r\n\r\nProtocol: our study protocol will involve two step: a step in laboratory, another step at\r\npatient home.\r\n\r\n  -  first step: both patients group will be recorded through a high density EEG and a\r\n     portative EEG while doing a task of symptom provocation. Then they will get an\r\n     anatomical MRI for source recontruction. Finally, the patients will have to mimic\r\n     their symptom while wearing an accelerometer (a smartwatch).\r\n\r\n  -  second step: both patient groups will be recorded at home through a portative EEG\r\n     while tagging their symptom through a smartwatch (also used for accelerometry).\r\n     After the recording, the patients will keep the smartwatch for 2 weeks, still\r\n     tagging their sympoms (compulsions or tics).",

Although there has been more\r\nattention to autism in older adults in recent years, there is still a lot of\r\nunfamiliarity with the phenomenon and underdiagnosis in (mental) health care. Many care\r\nproviders are reluctant to diagnose autism in later life, due to a lack of knowledge\r\nabout autism in older adults and because there is still very little scientific knowledge\r\navailable for this target group. Although several multidisciplinary guidelines for autism\r\nin adults prescribe that after the diagnosis psycho-education is the first step in\r\ntreatment, psycho-education is still only offered in a few places in the Netherlands.\r\nPsycho-education is important to help older people gain knowledge about their autism, to\r\nhelp them understand and accept this diagnosis, in order to subsequently make the\r\ntreatment of the problems, with which they turn to the mental health care, more\r\nappropriate and effective.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study is to contribute to better recognition and diagnosis of autism\r\namong older adults. This research also aims to improve a psycho-education program for\r\nolder adults and investigate its effects.\r\n\r\nThe scientific research question is whether training in ASD for health care professionals\r\nresults in better recognition and detection of ASD in older adults, and whether\r\nparticipation in the psycho-education course for older adults, who have recently been\r\ndiagnosed with autism, contributes to improvement of mental health and quality of life.",

The applicant's NSC project report also indicated that in all areas in the\r\nbehavior rating inventory of executive function, the second edition (BRIEF-2), including\r\ninhibit, self-monitor, shift, emotional control, initiate, working memory, plan/organize,\r\ntask-monitor, and organization of materials, children in the typically developmental\r\ngroup showed better performance than children in the ASD group. The results also\r\nindicated that compared to the diagnosis of ASD, an executive function could be a better\r\npredictor of daily life adaptation. Similarly, more and more researchers put their\r\nefforts into executive training. However, the results are mixed. A meta-analysis showed\r\nthat technology-based training can effectively improve the executive function of children\r\nwith ASD. Children with ASD love game-like training as it provides friendly environments\r\nto children with ASD and induces less anxiety. The applicant, therefore, plans to develop\r\na virtual reality executive function training program in the first year based on the\r\napplicant's previous experience with executive function training. The game will include\r\nthe components of visual searching, reaction time, shift, planning, and working memory.\r\nAt the end of the game, the game will provide visual feedback to the children to train in\r\nself-monitoring.

A better understanding of the true\r\nnumber of autistic children and young people is needed so that better support for them\r\ncan be provided.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to understand what autism looks like in Kent, Surrey, and Sussex (KSS)\r\nto better help autistic children and young people. To do this, schools will be asked\r\nabout the number of autistic children in their school to better understand the number of\r\nchildren and young people with autism in KSS. Secondly, autistic children and young\r\npeople will be interviewed to find out about the support they need.

    "title": "A Kinematic Analysis of Motor Planning and Movement Execution of Children With Autism Spectrum Condition",
    "description": "Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) is a behavioral syndrome characterized by a severe\r\norganizational disorder of thinking and major functions that regulate human adaptation.\r\nIt is to be considered as a functional disorder, or of executive functions, whose\r\ndysfunction is expressed in the difficulty of making voluntary movements, sequentially\r\ncoordinated with each other according to a purpose, and of initiating an action, planning\r\nand monitoring it by inhibiting inappropriate responses such as gesture perseveration.\r\nLiterature studies suggest that, compared to children with typical development (TD) and\r\nregardless of cognitive status, children with ASC have pervasive motor dysfunction that\r\nresults in universal difficulties in several aspects of motor function, including - (1)\r\nfine motricity, (2) some aspects of praxis while performing tasks based on imitation of\r\nsequences, (3) simultaneous coordination of both sides of the body during rhythmic tasks\r\nof the upper limbs, and\u0301 (4) interpersonal coordination and synchrony. The hypothesis of\r\nthe study is that by comparing these aspects in 2 groups of children with ASC and\r\nchildren with TD using A.I. systems, it will be possible to extract objective markers of\r\nmotor deficits found in autism, facilitating the validation of measurements acquired with\r\nclinical scales. The objective of the study is to investigate the characteristics of\r\nmanual motor planning and performance difficulties in children with ASC using kinematic\r\nmeasurements. 30 ASC children with medium-high functioning and 30 TD children, aged 7 to\r\n13 years, IQ > 80, in the absence of motor deficits due to another clinical condition,\r\nwill be recruited. The protocol will take place in a single session during which children\r\nwill be video-recorded performing simple and complex rhythmic upper limb actions with a\r\nsocial partner. The presence of characteristic fine motor behaviors, practice errors,\r\nperseverations, movement variability, and interpersonal synchrony will be observed. The\r\nstudy will involve the use of 3 tasks contained in NEPSY-II: Finger tapping, Visual-motor\r\nprecision, and Imitation of manual motor sequences. The videos will be recorded\r\nsimultaneously and the different angles will allow hand kinematics to be extracted and\r\nanalyzed with A.I. algorithms to measure displacement, velocity, acceleration, frequency\r\nand any other kinematic parameters highlighted. Thus, it is expected to identify\r\nobjective markers of motor deficits found in children with ASC.",

    "description": "In addition to the \"core\" symptoms of ASD (i.e., impaired communication, impaired\r\nreciprocal social interaction and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of\r\nbehaviors or interests), it is estimated that up to 70% of autistic people present at\r\nleast one comorbid psychiatric disorder, leading to a deterioration in quality of life, a\r\ngreater demand for support and worse prognosis and outcome. Anxiety and depressive\r\nsymptoms would seem to be more present in individuals with Level 1 ASD, requiring their\r\nprioritisation against core symptoms. To date, the first-line treatment for autistic\r\npatients with comorbid depressive and/or anxiety symptoms is still debated and it is not\r\nalways clear whether they may or may not benefit from psychotherapeutic and conventional\r\npsychopharmacological approaches. As such, growing evidence strengthens the therapeutic\r\npotential of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system modulation and of eCB-like compounds.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study is to provide a response to an unmet clinical need in this\r\nframework of psychic vulnerability by initiating oral therapy with palmitoylethanolamide\r\n(PEA), a nutraceutical/food supplement with proven anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nIndeed, many conditions of psychological distress are thought to be underpinned by\r\nsystemic inflammatory and/or neuroinflammatory processes, on which PEA has shown\r\nremarkable efficacy, including through modulation of the immune response and the\r\ninteraction between the endocannabinoid system and the gut-microbiota-brain axis.\r\n\r\nThe trial we are proposing is a 12-week open-label phase 2 study involving the daily\r\nintake of PEA 600 mg, at a dosage of 1 tablet/day.\r\n\r\nThis study will be conducted at the Unit of Psychiatry of Santa Maria della Misericordia\r\nUdine University Hospital.\r\n\r\nThrough this study, we wish to evaluate: the ability of PEA to alleviate symptoms of\r\npsychic distress (i.e., anxiety and/or depression) in Level 1 autistic adults; the safety\r\nand tolerability of sustained intake of PEA in Level 1 autistic adults; and the\r\nbiological basis of PEA functioning.\r\n\r\nThe study involves taking PEA orally once daily (600 mg daily) at the same time as a meal\r\nduring the initial 12-week phase. Upon completion of the initial phase, subjects will be\r\noffered to enter an extension phase of the trial of an additional 24 weeks to assess\r\ntreatment stability, with the possibility of titration of PEA to 1200 mg daily based on\r\nobserved clinical compensation. Each participant will be on PEA treatment for up to 36\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the study, periodic clinical re-evaluations will be conducted at our\r\nDay-Hospital setting.\r\n\r\nThe trial will unfold through one screening visit, one baseline visit, and two follow-up\r\nvisits (FUP, 4 weeks and 12 weeks apart). The patient will be administered standardized\r\ninterviews by a qualified investigating physician; clinical objective examination,\r\ncollection of blood and urine samples for standard hematochemical investigations,\r\ncollection of blood and stool samples for analysis of some biological markers of\r\ninterest, monitoring of adherence to therapy intake, side effects, and adverse effects\r\nwill also be performed during the follow-up visits.

    "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social\r\nimpairment, repetitive behaviors, and narrow interests. With advancements in diagnostic\r\ntechniques, the prevalence of ASD has been increasing annually. However, due to its\r\ncomplex and diverse etiology, there is no definitive consensus on the pathogenic\r\nmechanism of ASD. Numerous studies indicate that genetics, environment, and other factors\r\nplay crucial roles in the onset of ASD.\r\n\r\nVitamin A (VA) exerts its effects in the body through its active metabolite, retinoic\r\nacid (RA), which regulates the transcriptional activity and expression of downstream\r\ngenes by binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs/RXRs). Triggering Receptor Expressed on\r\nMyeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) is an immunoglobulin-like receptor present on microglial cells,\r\nwith functions including inhibiting the production of inflammatory factors and engulfing\r\napoptotic neurons. Recent foreign studies show a significant decrease in TREM2 levels in\r\nthe brain tissue of ASD patients. However, there is limited research on the relationship\r\nbetween TREM2 and ASD.\r\n\r\nIn our previous animal experiments, we observed a reduction in TREM2 in the prefrontal\r\ncortex of the brain in ASD model rats. Administering overexpressed TREM2 improved\r\nautism-like behavior in ASD model rats, and supplementing RA upregulated the expression\r\nof RA-RAR\u03b1 and TREM2, modulated microglial cell activation, and improved autism-like\r\nbehavior in rats. Therefore, we believe that the RA/RAR\u03b1 pathway regulates the TREM-2\r\nsignaling pathway, mediating changes in microglial cells, and TREM2 may be involved in\r\nthe pathogenesis of ASD.\r\n\r\nSoluble TREM2 (sTREM2) is formed by the extracellular domain shedding of TREM2 under the\r\naction of ADAM protease. Research indicates that the expression of sTREM2 can be detected\r\nin cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. However, the connection between VA, sTREM2 levels, and\r\nthe behavioral and developmental levels of children with ASD remains unclear and requires\r\nfurther clinical research to validate. This will help deepen our understanding of TREM2\r\nexpression in ASD, its potential biological functions, and the role of RA.",

To date, ASD\r\nhas no known cure, and the disorder remains a highly disabling condition. Recently,\r\ntranscranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation\r\ntechnique, has shown great promise as a potentially effective and cost-effective tool for\r\nreducing the core symptoms in patients with autism, such as anxiety, aggression,\r\nimpulsivity, and inattention. Although the preliminary findings in patients with ASD are\r\nencouraging, it remains to be determined whether this experimental data can translate\r\ninto benefits in real life. Further studies are needed to determine the factors that can\r\nlengthen the therapeutic effects or cognitive benefits of tDCS, and to determine possible\r\nrisk factors associated with relapse in patients with ASD. Booster sessions of tDCS is an\r\nimportant component of treatment planning and prognosis and may promote better outcomes\r\nto control for resurgence of symptoms. This study has three aims. First, the\r\ninvestigators aim to evaluate the therapeutic effects of tDCS on improving cognitive\r\nfunction in patients with ASD. Second, the investigators aim to better understand the\r\nneural mechanisms underlying the neuro-enhancing effects of tDCS in patients with ASD.\r\nThird, the investigators aim to assess the effectiveness of booster treatment cycles of\r\ntDCS for enhancing cognitive and social functions in individuals with ASD.",

    "title": "Social Relations Training for Children With ASD",
    "description": "The following protocol was developed with the intention of significantly improving social\r\nskills by focusing on increasing relationship skills among children with ASD. Divided\r\ninto two distinct parts, \"Basic Social Relationships\" and \"Intermediate Social\r\nRelationships,\" the protocol has 4 stages for the former and 5 stages for the latter.\r\nEach phase is preparatory to the next, and in addition, a teaching procedure is\r\nimplemented that adopts three prompt levels (partial, moderate and total), gradually\r\naiming to reduce the assistance provided to encourage independent response. This gradual\r\napproach is designed to stimulate greater independence in social interactions.\r\n\r\nThe training lasts between 6 and 12 months, with one or two weekly group meetings lasting\r\nforty-five minutes each. Before the start and at the end of the protocol, participants\r\nare assessed using the Vineland scale to evaluate their adaptive behaviors.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to enable children with autism to develop meaningful social skills,\r\nproviding them with concrete tools to interact more effectively and independently with\r\ntheir peers, thus improving their quality of life and social involvement. The protocol\r\ninvolves two distinct groups, experimental and control group.\r\n\r\nThe experimental group involves the use of a social robot that acts as a mediator in the\r\ninteractions among participants. The role of the social robot is to facilitate, reinforce\r\nand support the participants' responses during the activities. The therapist coordinates\r\nwith the social robot, helping to guide, reinforce and support participants'\r\ninteractions.\r\n\r\nIn the control group, the therapist takes on the role of mediating interactions, helping\r\nand facilitating participants' responses. There is no involvement of a social robot;\r\ntherefore,the therapist self acts directly to guide, reinforce and support the\r\nparticipants' social interactions.",

    "title": "Awareness Training in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.",
    "description": "The proposed protocol aims to facilitate awareness and understanding of autism spectrum\r\ndisorder among children aged 8 to 14 with an IQ between 85 and 115. Conducted once a week\r\nfor 60 minutes, the protocol encompasses two initial group sessions followed by 5 group\r\nmeetings, introducing activities to foster self-awareness, cognitive understanding, and\r\nan inclusive environment. Subsequently, the protocol advances to 12 individual sessions\r\nfocused on emotional well-being and self-awareness, integrating Oculus technology and\r\nchest sensors for heart rate monitoring. Initiating the intervention, individual family\r\nmeetings are scheduled to outline intervention goals and phases. The initial group\r\nsessions focus on social bonding, cognitive understanding, and creating an accepting\r\natmosphere among participants. Utilizing activities addressing neurodiversity awareness\r\nand technological tools like tablets, the sessions encourage discussions on individual\r\ndifferences and sensitivities. The subsequent individual sessions are structured to\r\nexplore personal values, identify inner critical voices, and develop emotional awareness\r\nthrough exercises exploring emotions and physical sensations. Progressively, the\r\nintervention introduces mindfulness, guiding participants to acknowledge emotions as\r\nnormal and encouraging alignment of daily actions with personal values. Following this,\r\nsessions center on building observational skills, recognizing past behaviors, and\r\nfostering strengths tied to values. Participants are encouraged to distinguish between\r\ntheir critical \"consultant\" and the value-driven \"explorer,\" fostering personal growth\r\nand reflection. The protocol's later stages delve into identifying personal strengths\r\nlinked to core values and exploring value-driven goals. Visual exercises, metaphors, and\r\nflexible self-views are emphasized, promoting adaptability and self-evolution. The\r\nprotocol concludes by advocating a flexible self-view, embracing change, and connecting\r\noneself to ever-evolving metaphors like \"a cup with changing contents\" or \"the\r\never-changing sky.\" These sessions culminate with visual relaxation facilitated through\r\nOculus technology while simultaneously monitoring participants' heart rates using chest\r\nsensors. This comprehensive approach integrates technological tools with emotional and\r\ncognitive exercises, providing a multifaceted framework to enhance self-awareness and\r\npromote acceptance within the context of neurodiversity.",

Autism\r\nspectrum disorder can affect the quality of life of an individual to a severe extent.\r\nThis disorder due to sensory processing deficits also shows difficulty in motor planning,\r\ncoordination and execution of tasks which can make performing activities of daily living\r\nhighly difficult to perform. It is called a developmental disorder because it affects the\r\ngrowth. Milestones are often delayed in individuals with autism. Due to these deficits\r\nindividual with autism if not provided with therapies at the right age can stay dependent\r\non caretaker for their whole life. Rapid repetitive behaviors also known as\r\nself-stimulatory behaviors are a way to compensate with anxiety, difficulty in processing\r\nsensory information and are often used to stimulate themselves to feel calm. Though not a\r\ndiagnostic symptom autism often still presents with vestibular dysfunction which affects\r\nthe balance. Several individuals with autism have showed abnormal vestibular ocular\r\nreflexes; abnormally long latency of saccades.

    "title": "Prevalence and Healthcare Consumption of ASD Patients Using French Medico-administrative Data",
    "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the neurodevelopmental disorders described in\r\nthe DSM5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This heterogeneous syndrome appears in\r\nchildhood and persists throughout life with different developments from one individual to\r\nanother. It is clinically characterized by the combination of deficits in social\r\ncommunication with restricted and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of ASD has seen a\r\nsignificant increase over the last 10 years, with estimates varying greatly from one\r\ncountry to another, ranging from 4.2/1,000 in France to 31/1,000 in Iceland. In France,\r\nprevalence has been estimated by two child disability registers set up in the departments\r\nof Haute-Garonne (RHE31), Is\u00e8re, Savoie, and Haute-Savoie (RHEOP), but there is no\r\nepidemiological surveillance system to estimate the national prevalence of ASD in the\r\ngeneral population. However, the production of reliable epidemiological data at the\r\nnational and territorial levels is essential for addressing the needs of individuals with\r\nASD and for evaluating public policies.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of our project is to estimate the annual prevalence of ASD in\r\nchildren, adolescents, and young adults at the national and regional levels using\r\nmedico-administrative databases (SNDS), to study its evolution over the period 2010-2019\r\nand its geographical distribution in relation to socio-demographic indicators and\r\nhealthcare accessibility. Our secondary objectives are to validate an algorithm for\r\ndetecting ASD in the National Health Data System (SNDS) and to estimate the direct\r\nmedical costs associated with ASD management.\r\n\r\nThe SNDS databases contain all medical care and treatments reimbursed for Health\r\nInsurance beneficiaries provided in the private or public sector. A case detection\r\nalgorithm will be tested and validated on validation samples. Then, the prevalence of ASD\r\nwill be estimated, taking into account geographical, socio-economic, and healthcare\r\naccessibility indicators, in order to study the factors associated with the significant\r\ndisparity in rates observed in France and abroad. An estimate of direct medical costs\r\nwill be made from the health insurance perspective.\r\n\r\nOur project therefore proposes the development of reliable indicators on the management\r\nof ASD in France with the aim of providing useful indicators and tools for guiding health\r\nand disability policies in France, promoting the development of appropriate\r\ninterventions, and thus contributing to the improvement of the care and support of\r\nindividuals with ASD as well as reducing inequalities in access to healthcare for these\r\nvulnerable populations.",

This makes it an excellent complementary treatment to the activity\r\nof rehabilitation treatment. Its effects are achieved by establishing several input nerve\r\npathways corresponding to the body's dermis, through which the signals are\r\nintellectualised in time-space.

This condition manifests itself differently in each individual and can vary\r\ngreatly in severity and impact on daily life.\r\n\r\nAutistic children may present various challenges and difficulties in developing daily\r\nliving skills (DLS). These difficulties may relate to various areas, such as personal\r\nautonomy and domestic autonomy.

    "title": "Efficacy of Bumetanide to Improve Cognitive Functions in Down Syndrome",
    "description": "The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a known diuretic drug,\r\nBumetanide, in terms of improvement of memory and psychological functioning in children\r\nand adolescents with Down syndrome (DS), in order to develop therapeutic strategies for\r\ncognitive and psychopathology aspects associated with the syndrome. The study also aims\r\nto identify possible predictors and biological and genetic markers related to the\r\nefficacy of the treatment. Recently, preliminary studies conducted on the animal model of\r\nDown syndrome have proven the efficacy of the drug Bumetanide in counteracting some brain\r\nanomalies related to communication between nerve cells (synaptic transmission) typical of\r\nthe syndrome, with the effect of improving memory skills. Behaviour-enhancing effects\r\nhave also been found in preliminary studies in humans with other neurodevelopmental\r\ndisorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders). The drug Bumetanide could therefore be\r\nuseful in counteracting the biological mechanisms that cause some cognitive deficits\r\nassociated with Down syndrome. The potential of this therapeutic approach will be tested\r\nthrough a clinical trial in a population of children and adolescent patients with DS, in\r\na randomized placebo-controlled trial with a three-month treatment with Bumetanide.\r\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to the experimental group that will receive the\r\ntreatment (Bumetanide) vs the control/comparison group that will receive the placebo.\r\nBumetanide is a diuretic drug that has been widely used in humans in the past with few\r\nside effects, is orally active, and is very inexpensive. 64 participants will be\r\nrecruited.",

In this study, the investigators\r\nare testing whether strategies that have been found to improve word learning in\r\nnon-autistic children will also help autistic children. Specifically, the investigators\r\naim to test whether autistic children learn words more successfully if novel words are\r\ntaught by repeating the words to the child (re-study) or if the novel words are taught\r\nfirst with labeling each word and then quizzing the child (repeated quizzing).\r\n\r\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\r\n\r\n  -  When teaching nouns (names of exotic animals), is learning stronger if autistic\r\n     children re-study or engage in repeated quizzing of the newly taught words?\r\n\r\n  -  When teaching adjectives (visible features of objects, like a bumpy chair), is\r\n     learning stronger if autistic children re-study or engage in repeated quizzing of\r\n     the newly taught adjectives?\r\n\r\n  -  Does the word learning condition (re-study vs. repeated quizzing) impact whether\r\n     autistic children are more successful in demonstrating their knowledge of the newly\r\n     taught words in different contexts?\r\n\r\n  -  Are autistic features related to patterns of word learning?\r\n\r\nParticipants will:\r\n\r\n  -  Learn new words with half of the words being taught in one way (re-study) and the\r\n     other half of the words being taught in the other way (repeated quizzing).\r\n\r\n  -  Participate in 5-minute and 1-week tests of the newly taught words to measure child\r\n     learning.\r\n\r\n  -  Complete other language, thinking, and autism clinical assessments.",

    "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), according to the diagnostic criteria of Diagnostic and\r\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders- V Edition (DSM-5), is a disorder involving (a)\r\npersistent deficits in social communication, social interaction and (b) patterns of\r\nrestricted and stereotyped behavior and/or interests and/or activities. Specifically,\r\nimpairment in social interaction manifests itself in different areas of individual\r\nfunctioning and through various facets: social-emotional reciprocity, poor understanding\r\nof social rules, reduced sharing of interests, emotions or feelings, reduced or absent\r\ntheory of mind, inability to initiate or respond to social interactions (turn-taking in\r\nconversation), and difficulties in the use of communication. Facial expressions, vocal\r\nintonation, postures and gestures are crucial components of non-verbal communication that\r\nplay a fundamental role in social-communicative functions. However, people with ASD may\r\nshow significant deficits in these forms of expression, negatively affecting the ability\r\nto generate an appropriate social response, which is essential for initiating and\r\nmaintaining social interactions. Children with ASD tend to avoid eye contact with others\r\nand show little or no interest in people, often looking past them or away from them. This\r\nbehavior contributes to presenting them as \"markedly aloof and distant\". The aim of the\r\nstudy is to explore the effect of specific expressive tasks, conducted by highly\r\nqualified personnel, in a group setting, by means of targeted theatrical activities.\r\nThese activities include exercises focusing on the use of voice and posture, the variety\r\nof vocal intonations and the harmonization between verbal production and facial\r\nexpressiveness. In the context of this study, 20 children will be involved, divided into\r\nan experimental group and a control group. The experimental group will include 10\r\nchildren with ASD who voluntarily participate in activities organized by the IRIB-CNR of\r\nMessina. These children, aged between 6 and 11 years, present a medium-high level of\r\ncognitive functioning, as assessed by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children- IV\r\nEdition (WISC-IV) cognitive test.

However, a direct comparison\r\namong different types and intensity of early support in community setting and relatively\r\nlow access to standardized and intensive programs, have not been adequately explored. For\r\nthis reason, the aim of this study is to investigate, in a community setting in the\r\nItalian context, the impact of ESDM and support intensity on individual developmental\r\ntrajectories.",

    "title": "Probiotics for Depression in Cancer Patients",
    "description": "Anxiety and depressive disorders are quite prevalent in the general population. In 2015,\r\nit was estimated that 3.6% of the world population (around 264 million individuals) live\r\nwith depression and 4.4% (around 322 million) with anxiety, while in the recent years of\r\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of these disorders has significantly increased.\r\n\r\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association, in 2013 depression was defined as a\r\nserious mental illness characterized by decreased mood lasting more than 15 days, a lack\r\nof interest, and (even) apathy to normal daily activities. Depression, particularly in\r\nits severe form - the major depressive disorder (MDD), is the second leading cause of\r\ndisability and the most common emotional disorder.\r\n\r\nRecent research data indicate that this psychiatric disorder, as also similar\r\nneuropsychological conditions (Parkinson's, autism, etc.) have, as their main substrate,\r\na disturbance in the diversity of the gut microbiome. More specifically, it has been\r\nshown that there is a direct and bidirectional communication between gut and brain - the\r\n\"gut-brain-axis\". The gut, through its microbiome, communicates with the brain by means\r\nof neural, immunological, and metabolic pathways, either directly, through the vagus\r\nnerve or indirectly, either through the microbiome immunomodulation or the tryptophan\r\npathway, or by the production of various neuroactive molecules.\r\n\r\nThe disturbance in the diversity of the gut microbiome, termed dysbiosis, involves\r\nchanges in the composition and the number of bacteria genera; and is causatively related\r\nto depression via the gut-brain axis. The transmission of nerve impulses, both via the\r\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and via the vagus nerve is disrupted by dysbiosis,\r\nleading to anxiety and depression, or, conversely, stressful conditions, more\r\nparticularly emotional stress, which triggers an imbalance in the\r\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to systemic immune responses and intestinal\r\ndysbiosis. This imbalance can clinically manifest with alterations in digestive tract\r\nfunction, knowledge accepted since the beginning of the previous century.\r\n\r\nNowadays, there is considerable evidence that the gut microbiome represents a novel\r\nanti-depressant and the term \"psychobiotics\" has been used to describe those species of\r\nprobiotic bacteria excreting mental health benefits.\r\n\r\nCertain Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species have already demonstrated, both\r\nexperimentally and in clinical studies, their capability to improve mood, reduce anxiety,\r\nand enhance cognitive function. On these grounds, it is reasonable to raise the\r\nhypothesis that, by restoring the diversity of the gut microbiome, and thus enhancing the\r\npopulation of these specific probiotic species - termed 'psychobiotics', due to their\r\nspecified functions, - could at least lead to an improvement in neuro-psychological\r\ndisorders through gut-brain-axis remodeling.",

The current study is an uncontrolled (pre-post) feasibility trial of\r\nFamily-School Partnership Intervention (FPSI). FSPI was developed using stakeholder\r\ninput, is delivered by existing preschool staff, and aims to promote development and\r\nreduce barriers to learning among children with pre-clinical social-communication delays.\r\nFSPI integrates evidence-based practices (EBPs) from education (7 EBPs; National\r\nAssociation for the Education of Young Children) with clinical interventions for toddlers\r\nwith autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (12 EBPs at the educator-parent level and 8 EBPs at\r\nthe parent-child level; Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions). Data will\r\nbe collected across 10 ECE programs. At each participating ECE program, research\r\nprocedures will be completed during a single school year. Selected ECE programs will\r\ninclude public school, Head Start, and private preschool programs. Participants include\r\n20 non-teaching support staff (1-2 per program; e.g., director, principal,\r\neducation-coordinator), 30 lead teachers (2-4 per program), and 60 children with\r\nsocial-communication deficits (two per teacher). Data collection will focus on\r\nfeasibility data (enrollment, attendance, attrition, data completion), observational\r\nmeasures of implementation fidelity (at the educator-parent and parent-child level), and\r\nmixed methods to evaluate educator and parent acceptability and satisfaction and identify\r\nimplementation drivers/barriers. This research will prepare a large, multi-site hybrid\r\ntrial to evaluate the effectiveness of FSPI for promoting social-communication skills and\r\nkindergarten readiness, in addition to factors that mediate the relation between FSPI\r\ndelivery and fidelity (implementation drivers/barriers).",

    "description": "The increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (1 in 36 youth) in the United States\r\nalong with the exorbitant cost of care of supporting one autistic individual with and\r\nwithout intellectual disability across their lifespan ($2.4 and $1.4 million,\r\nrespectively) creates a sense of urgency to improve outcomes for autistic youth. Schools\r\nare the primary setting in which autistic children receive intervention. Despite a\r\ngrowing array of evidence-based interventions (EBI) such as behavioral management, EBIs\r\noften are unavailable in schools due to misalignment of existing implementation\r\nstrategies (IS) with that setting. Large numbers of IS have been described for the\r\neducation sector, but there is a dire need to identify the most efficient IS to support\r\nuse of EBI in resource-strapped public schools.

    "title": "Butyrate Supplementation in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders",
    "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition occurring in 1:77\r\nItalian children. Several comorbidities are reported, including functional\r\ngastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) present in up to 70% of patients. FGIDs are disorders\r\nresulting from a combination of symptoms affecting motility, hypersensitivity, and other\r\nfunctions, which are not caused by anatomic or organic origin and that impact the\r\nseverity of ASD core symptoms and complicate the clinical management of ASD children,\r\nespecially those who are non-verbal. Evidence reports gut microbiome (GM) remodelling in\r\nASD children, and postbiotic butyrate, a GM-derived metabolite, attenuates FGIDs in\r\nchildren and restores social behavior in ASD mouse models. Clinical data on butyrate\r\neffects in ASD are still scanty. The present study investigates the therapeutic effects\r\nof a 16-week oral postbiotic supplementation on clinical/behavioral profiles,\r\ngastrointestinal disturbances, gut microbiome, and immune and inflammatory biomarkers in\r\nperipheral blood and fecal samples in children with ASD and FGIDs. Using the Machine\r\nLearning (ML) approach, a subset of artificial intelligence, this study also aims to\r\nidentify predictive factors implicated in the effect of the postbiotic supplementation on\r\nFGIDs, important for prevention through modulation of the microbiota.

    "title": "Effects of rTMS on Cognitive Functions and Behavior in Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorder",
    "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with core\r\nsymptoms that include impairments in social communication and restricted and repetitive\r\nbehaviors, interests, and activities. Social cognition is a broad term used to\r\nunderstand, perceive, and interpret information about others and ourselves in a social\r\ncontext. Impairments in social cognition are often highlighted as a potential mechanism\r\nunderlying social disability in autism spectrum disorder. High-order cognitive functions,\r\nsuch as Executive function (EF) and social cognition, rely on neural network oscillations\r\nin the gamma frequency (30-80 Hz) band. It has been proposed that GABA-inhibitory\r\ninterneurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) contribute to the\r\nsynchronization of pyramidal neurons, which is necessary for EF performance. Impaired\r\nGABAergic neurotransmission within the DLPFC has been linked with altered gamma\r\noscillatory activity and working memory deficits. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)\r\nis one method used to deliver electrical stimuli through the scalp in conscious humans.\r\nRecently, rTMS is not only for the treatment of major depressive disorders, but it has\r\nalso been advanced as a potential therapeutic technique to treat neurologic disorders\r\nsuch as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and\r\nmultiple sclerosis, and many other neuropsychiatric disorders. It is still undetermined\r\nwhether it is possible to improve the symptoms of ASD individuals through noninvasive\r\nneural modulation. Previous studies in ASD indicate that rTMS applied to DLPFC can\r\nmodulate gamma oscillatory activity.\r\n\r\nIn this study, the investigators aim to examine the effectiveness of low-frequency rTMS\r\nin improving social cognitive function and emotion recognition in ASD individuals.\r\n\r\nFurther understanding of the effect of low-frequency rTMS in altering the cognitive\r\nfunction in ASD individuals may help to achieve some answers related to the mechanism\r\nbehind ASD. This stimulation protocol could be a vital therapeutic strategy for the\r\ntreatment of ASD in future clinical practice.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of Video-feedback for Positive Parenting with Children At Risk of ASD",
    "description": "Improving parent-child interactions benefits child development and parents' perception of\r\ntheir competencies for childrearing and support for child learning and development, which\r\nin turns positively impacts on parental emotional well-being and Family Qualiy of Life.\r\n\r\nThis intervention protocol aims to improve the quality of parent-child interactions in\r\ndaily-routine activities (bath time, dressing, mails...), specially during play\r\ninteractions at home, increasing the frequency and consistency of the 29 positive\r\nparental behaviors included in the PICCOLO. PICCOLO is an observational tool for\r\nassessing positive parental behaviors in caregiver-child interactions that have been\r\npositively related to child cognitive, socioemotional, and linguistic development. It was\r\ndeveloped and published in the United States, and it was validated in Spain with mothers\r\nand fathers. An Spanish handbook has been also published.\r\n\r\nGuiding principles of the intervention protocol are an emphasis on the parents'\r\nstrengths; a focus on daily routines in family context; and a non-directive intervention\r\nstyle, based on video feedback and coaching strategies as self-appraisal and reflection.\r\n\r\nAlthough the protocol could be applied to different populations, this study is\r\nimplemented with mothers and fathers with a young child (aged 24-36 months) at risk of\r\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). All children and their families are being cared for by\r\nprofessionals in Early Intervention Centers in Spain. Inclusion criteria for receiving\r\nthis intervention are a) child at medium-high risk of ASD; b) primary caregiver at risk\r\nof anxiety, depression, or parental stress; c) primary caregiver with a low or medium-low\r\nlevel of positive parental behaviors in the PICCOLO.\r\n\r\nThe protocol includes bimonthly sessions of 60 minutes duration for six months with the\r\nmain caregiver who participates in the program. Sessions are conducted by\r\nvideoconference. Every session focuses on three different PICCOLO behaviors that have\r\nbeen identified in a previously recorded caregiver-child interaction during play at home\r\n(book-reading, symbolic play, or manipulative play). A new video is auto recorded every\r\nmonth by parents, so that each video is analyzed together with the caregiver in two\r\nsessions. After each session, the parents receive a written reminder of the aspects that\r\nhave been worked on in the video feedback session, and of the agreements regarding the\r\nsituations of daily life in which these aspects could be put into practice.\r\n\r\nFamily picture-books are progressively created, including selected frames from the\r\nvideotapes that illustrate the positive parental behaviors that have been discussed. Six\r\nnew images are included every month. Caregivers are encouraged to look at and talk about\r\nthe book with their children at home and to share it with other family members.\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of the proposed study is to assess the efficacy of an intervention to\r\nimprove caregiver competencies through the observation of caregiver-child interaction,\r\nusing video-feedback coaching strategies based on parental strengths, from a\r\ncollaborative model.\r\n\r\nIt is hypothesized that (1) developmentally supportive parental behaviors of mothers and\r\nfathers, measured with PICCOLO, after the intervention will be significantly higher in\r\nthe intervention group (IG) than in the control group (CG); (2) levels of anxiety, or\r\ndepression and/or stress of mothers and fathers after intervention will be significantly\r\nlower in the IG than in the CG; (3) Parental self-efficacy of mothers and fathers after\r\nthe intervention will be significantly higher in the IG than in the CG; and (4) family\r\nquality of life after intervention will be significantly higher in the IG than in the CG.\r\nAlso, it is hypothesized that individual trajectories in families within the IG will show\r\nchanges in the outcome variables consistent with these expectations during the\r\nintervention period. it is hypothesized that these positive changes will not be observed\r\nin the CG, who will continue receiving the usual early intervention services.\r\n\r\nWith respect to intervention assessment, it is hypothesized that there will be\r\nsignificant and positive associations between key outcomes of the study and the scores\r\nobtained on the HOVRS-3 measure of four evidence-based home visiting practices:\r\nrelationship building with families, responsiveness to family strengths, facilitating\r\nfamily interaction, collaboration with caregivers.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is expected to find a secondary benefit on child's development, assessed with\r\nthe DP-3 (Developmental Profile-3), particularly in the communication and social\r\nadaptation areas.",

    "title": "Impact of AAI Dogs on Performance and Behavior of Children with Autism",
    "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder usually\r\ndiagnosed in early childhood. Children with ASD exhibit social communication and\r\ninteraction problems, which may cause deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, problems\r\nwith developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, and abnormal nonverbal\r\ncommunicative behaviors such as impaired eye contact and body language. Some children\r\nwith ASD have severe behavioral problems, such as stereotyped or repetitive motor\r\nmovements, and extreme distress at small changes. ASD is a complex and individualized\r\ndisorder, which creates challenges in treatment.\r\n\r\nAnimal-assisted education (AAE) programmes have been introduced for children with special\r\nneeds in other countries such as the United States and Australia. PAALS (Palmetto Animal\r\nAssisted Life Services) in the United States have introduced the Pet a PAALS Dog\r\nprogramme, which assists stressed students at USC (University of South Carolina).\r\nAssistance Dogs Australia has provided an Educational Support Dog Echo to Kalinda Support\r\nSchool, for children with a wide range of disabilities. Existing literature indicate the\r\nbenefit of animal-assisted therapy on physical, behavioral, and cognitive disabilities,\r\nespecially in social and communication disorders. Formally trained human-dog teams in\r\nanimal-assisted interventions (AAI) can play a unique role in social and communicative\r\ndevelopment that schools, and caregivers may not be able to provide. Interacting with\r\nanimal-assisted intervention dogs can increase children with\r\nASD&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s social interaction, communication, and effective\r\nconnection. Dogs can also provide emotional support in stressful situations such as\r\ncalming the child down when they have a tantrum. Moreover, animal-assisted therapy has\r\nshown to decrease stress levels, anxiety, and restrictive and repetitive behavior\r\npatterns. Dogs as pets can also bring significant improvements to caregivers of children\r\nwith ASD and improve conflict management.\r\n\r\nBased on a successful pilot trial in 2019 with 8 children showed that AAI program has a\r\npositive effect on the performance of children with ASD, The investigator proposed an\r\nobservational study that tracks the effectiveness of an animal-assisted intervention\r\nprogramme in a local school for children with ASD and developmental disabilities.",

The prevalence of DLD is ~7%-8% or 2%\r\nif severe forms are considered.\r\n\r\nHowever, the clinical heterogeneity of language disorders, the presence of co-morbidities\r\nand the inconsistent terminology used for many years have hindered research and clinical\r\npractice. Distinguishing sub-groups of children with language problems is crucial when\r\ntackling the underlying genetic causes of this disease. Recently, several studies using\r\nhigh-throughput sequencing have better define the genetic basis of CAS but such studies\r\nfocusing on DLD are limited. The investigation of more homogeneous cohorts of individuals\r\nthat clearly distinguish DLD cases, from ID and not including children with CAS should\r\nimprove our understanding of the genetic basis of this disorder.\r\n\r\nIn this study, we aim to built and investigate a well-characterized cohort of DLD\r\npatients using pangenomic approaches to better define the molecular basis of this\r\ndisorder. All individuals will be analyzed using chromosomal microarray analysis and\r\nwhole genome sequencing. Multiple observations and preliminary results suggest strong\r\nlinks with the genetic basis of other neurodevelopmental disorders.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to identify CNV or SNV as causative allele or risk factor and already known\r\nto be involved in other neurodevelopmental disorders as well as potential new variants.",

    "description": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a rare genetic syndrome, caused by a mutation in the FMR1\r\ngene located on the X chromosome. It is considered the leading hereditary cause of\r\nintellectual disability (ID) and the primary cause of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) due\r\nto a single gene-mutation. Many individuals with FXS exhibit symptoms overlapping with\r\nthose of ASD, including difficulties in social-communication skills, challenges in peer\r\nrelationships, restricted and repetitive behaviors/interests and deficits in adaptive\r\nfunctioning. Both in ASD and FXS, individuals with greater deficits in executive\r\nfunctions, socio-pragmatic, and socio-relational skills also demonstrate lower adaptive\r\nfunctioning and, consequently, reduced autonomy/independence throughout the life course\r\nand greater severity of the disorder.\r\n\r\nAmong empirically validated treatments recommended by National and International\r\nGuidelines for the treatment of ASD, cognitive-behavioral and psychosocial interventions\r\nhave been shown to improve some aspects of ASD, such as core symptoms,\r\nemotional-behavioral disturbances, adaptive skills, and quality of life. Currently, it\r\nappears that cognitive-behavioral therapies, which include psychoeducation programs, are\r\nparticularly appropriate for ASD, with greater efficacy for group interventions compared\r\nto individual ones. Regarding FXS, despite the well-established knowledge of the\r\ncognitive-behavioral phenotype and the clear need for scientifically validated programs,\r\nresearch on intervention strategies remains quite limited.\r\n\r\nConsidering the similarities between ASD and FXS and the need for standardized\r\ninterventions, the present research project aims to conduct an RCT to evaluate the\r\nfeasibility of Cooperative Group Therapy (CGT) in two different groups of adolescents\r\nwith ASD and FXS. The decision to target the intervention to adolescents is due to the\r\nfew clinical studies on this age group, which is a crucial target since, in FXS, there is\r\noften a plateau or reversal of intellectual and adaptive development after the age of 10,\r\nand in adolescents with ASD, the development and complexity of social, pragmatic skills,\r\nand executive functions are crucial for good adaptive functioning and a basic quality of\r\nlife. Te main hypothesis is that CGT could contribute to the reduction of severity\r\nillness and in the enhancement of socio-communicative skills.",

    "description": "The main objective of this research is to measure the influence of equine-assisted\r\ntherapy sessions on the quality of life of children with ASD, using the PedsQL\u2122 4.0\r\nquestionnaire as an evaluation tool.\r\n\r\nThe secondary objectives of this study are to measure the influence of these equine\r\ntherapy sessions on the quality of life of parents of children with ASD, using the\r\nPAR-DD-QOL questionnaire, and to qualitatively analyze the progress of children in terms\r\nof communication, motor skills, social connections, etc., during equine therapy sessions,\r\nthrough tracking sheets.\r\n\r\nThis interventional, prospective, and monocentric study aims to evaluate the effect of\r\nequine therapy on the quality of life of children with ASD and their families. As a pilot\r\nstudy, it aims to assess the feasibility of a larger-scale study with a rigorous\r\nmethodology, with the aim of including a control group and conducting a randomized,\r\nmulticentric, single-blind trial in future studies. It will take place at the La Musse\r\nHospital - La Renaissance Sanitaire, specifically within the equine therapy center of the\r\nLa Musse facilities. Recruiting 20 children (8-12 years old) with ASD is required for\r\nthis study. To do this, the inclusion criteria are as follows: participants must be\r\nchildren aged 8 to 12, diagnosed with ASD by a doctor. They must be able to participate\r\nin equine-assisted therapy sessions and understand instructions during these sessions. In\r\naddition, they must be affiliated with the social security system. The primary and\r\nsecondary assessment criteria respectively include the average of the two scores obtained\r\nfrom the PedsQL\u2122 4.0 child and parent report questionnaires; the overall score of the\r\nPAR-DD-QOL questionnaire, as well as the qualitative analysis of the equine therapists'\r\ntracking sheets. Measures are taken to minimize selection, recruitment, and confusion\r\nbiases, and specific eligibility criteria are defined. Each participant will benefit from\r\n15 equine therapy sessions, twice a week, over 7 to 8 weeks. Each session will last 60\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThe intervention of this study begins with the participant selection process, including\r\nan initial contact by phone or during a medical consultation, followed by an oral\r\nexplanation and the provision of written information to parents and the child. After a\r\nreflection period, and if they agree, the parents and the child sign a consent form. The\r\nchildren then undergo 15 equine therapy sessions, including various activities such as\r\nemotional expression, contact with the horse, grooming, activities on foot or on\r\nhorseback, and a debriefing time. Quality-of-life evaluations will be conducted five\r\ntimes during the study using the PedsQL\u2122 4.0 child, PedsQL\u2122 4.0 parent report, and\r\nPAR-DD-QOL questionnaires (before the first session, after the first session, at the 5th\r\nsession, at the 10th session, and at the 15th session). Additionally, a tracking sheet\r\nwill be completed by equine therapists during the sessions. The criteria for interrupting\r\nor modifying interventions are established, allowing participants to withdraw at any time\r\nfor various reasons. Strategies are implemented to improve adherence to rehabilitation\r\nprotocols, such as regular reminders and the distribution of a schedule of appointments.\r\nThe individuals concerned are fully informed of the study and their rights.\r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes include an improvement in the average quality-of-life scores of\r\nchildren with ASD, an improvement in the quality-of-life score of their parents, and\r\nbehavioral progress in the children.

    "description": "Background and Justification Childhood developmental disorders, such as Autism Spectrum\r\nDisorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Developmental\r\nCoordination Disorder (DCD), pose significant challenges for children and their families.\r\nThese disorders impact children's growth and learning, leading to difficulties in key\r\nareas such as language, communication, behavior, social interaction, and motor skills.\r\nResearch in this area is limited, particularly regarding fine and gross motor skills in\r\nrelation to sensory processing in children with these diagnoses.\r\n\r\nHypothesis and Objectives There is an association between motor skills and sensory\r\nprocessing in children aged 4 to 11 years, depending on whether they have typical or\r\natypical neurodevelopment, such as ASD, ADHD, and DCD.\r\n\r\nMain Objective:\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the association between motor skills and sensory processing in children aged\r\n4 to 11 years with either typical or atypical neurodevelopment (e.g., ASD, ADHD, and\r\nDCD).\r\n\r\nSecondary Objectives:\r\n\r\nTo describe and compare motor skills among children aged 4 to 11 years with typical or\r\natypical neurodevelopment, such as ASD, ADHD, and DCD.\r\n\r\nTo describe and compare sensory processing among children aged 4 to 11 years with typical\r\nor atypical neurodevelopment, such as ASD, ADHD, and DCD.\r\n\r\nMethodology The study is a cross-sectional observational case-control study. Participants\r\nare users of the Child Development and Early Intervention Center (CDIAP) Tris Tras, Neuro\r\nXics, or Criv in Vic.\r\n\r\nThe sample will include 30 children as controls (typical neurodevelopment) and 10\r\nchildren as cases (atypical neurodevelopment: ASD, ADHD, DCD).\r\n\r\nChildren will be assessed using the Infant Motor Profile (IMP) to measure motor\r\ndevelopment and the Short Sensory Profile-2 (SSP-2) to evaluate sensory processing.\r\n\r\nStatistical Analysis Quantitative variables will be described using means and standard\r\ndeviations, while categorical variables will be presented as frequencies and percentages.\r\nStatistical tests such as the Student's t-test will be used to compare means between two\r\ngroups, ANOVA for comparisons among more than two groups, and the Chi-square test to\r\nanalyze associations between categorical variables.\r\n\r\nExpected Results The study is expected to provide essential insights into the differences\r\nin motor development between children with typical and atypical neurodevelopment, as well\r\nas the relationship between biological and external factors and these differences. These\r\nfindings could help improve clinical and educational interventions for these children by\r\ntailoring them to their specific needs, thereby enhancing their overall well-being and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nEthical Considerations The study protocol will be submitted to the Research Ethics\r\nCommittee (CER) of UVic-UCC, adhering to good clinical practice guidelines in accordance\r\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki.

The program provides tools to support children with autism.\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility of implementing the\r\nIY-HPCA intervention among teachers of preschool children (typically aged 2 to 5 years)\r\nworking in mainstream schools. Specifically, we aim to assess teachers' engagement,\r\nacceptability, and satisfaction with the program. Secondarily, we aim to gather\r\npreliminary evidence on the program's effectiveness in improving teachers' use of\r\nstrategies, teacher self-efficacy, and in reducing burnout.\r\n\r\nWe will conduct an exploratory randomized controlled pilot trial. We aim to recruit\r\napproximately 40 teachers, and they will be randomly assigned to either an intervention\r\nor control group.\r\n\r\nThe intervention consists of six weekly sessions lasting 3 hours each, delivered by\r\nclinical psychologists and child psychiatrists specialized in developmental disorders at\r\nHospital Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, in Barcelona. Two intervention face-to-face groups will be\r\nconducted at Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00e9u.\r\n\r\nFeasibility outcomes include program attendance, acceptability, and satisfaction\r\n(assessed using the Incredible Years Teacher Workshop Evaluations and the Teacher\r\nSatisfaction Questionnaire), as well as fidelity to the intervention delivery (measured\r\nwith the Leader Checklist). After the intervention, individual interviews with teachers\r\nand group leaders will qualitatively assess satisfaction and experiences with the\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nSecondary (effectiveness) outcomes include teachers' use of strategies (Teacher\r\nStrategies Questionnaire for Children with Autism), self-efficacy (Teacher Sense of\r\nEfficacy Scale), and burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory-Educators Survey).\r\n\r\nThis study will provide pioneering insights into the implementation of this program\r\nwithin the public mental health and education systems in Spain.

    "title": "Telehealth Intervention for Infants With Prodromes of ASD",
    "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by\r\nsocial-communication and interaction deficits and restricted, repetitive patterns of\r\ninterests and behavior. It is frequently associated with heterogeneous comorbidities\r\nincluding physical, mental, and neurodevelopmental disorders, which can result in a\r\nsubstantial burden on individuals, families, and society.\r\n\r\nEarly prodromal signs of ASD emerge during the first year of life, a time when brain\r\nplasticity is at its maximum level, and may consist of diminished social orienting,\r\nresponsivity and reciprocity combined with the presence of prolonged visual fixation and\r\nrepetitive use of objects. Developmental immaturities in communication and motor skills\r\nare often present too. Pre-emptive Intervention (PI) for infants with prodromal signs of\r\nASD was shown to improve outcomes, in comparison to later starts, by improving\r\ndevelopmental skills, reducing ASD symptoms and, in some cases, preventing the full blown\r\nsymptoms of ASD. Moreover, access to early evidence-based interventions may reduce the\r\nelevated levels of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms experienced by caregivers of\r\nchildren with signs of ASD.\r\n\r\nDespite this evidence, professionals tend to have a 'wait to see' approach, rather than\r\ntargeting areas of impairment with early intervention. Moreover, the vast majority of\r\ncurrent clinical models of ASD services require a diagnosis to receive services, while\r\nthe identification of prodromal signs of the disorders generally is not sufficient to\r\naccess early intervention. There is an urgent need for a paradigm shift in ASD treatment.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Project aims to evaluate the efficacy of FIRRST, a parent-mediated PI for\r\ninfants with early signs of ASD. We will conduct a multisite RCT of telehealth PI by\r\nrecruiting 132 symptomatic infants between 9-14 months and randomly assigning them to\r\nreceive either FIRSST (experimental group), or Parent Education (control group).\r\nDevelopmental skills, ASD symptomatology, caregiver well-being and brain changes on\r\nHigh-Density EEG will be assessed with in-presence evaluations at three time points: 1.\r\nbaseline; 2. after 24 weeks of intervention; 3. follow-up after 24 weeks from the end of\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nIf funded, The proposed study will be the first well-powered RCT evaluating\r\ndevelopmental, symptom and neurophysiological changes in response to a parent-mediated PI\r\nconducted in Europe. The ultimate goal for translational research in ASD lies in the\r\noptimization of clinical outcomes through the most effective, targeted, and timely\r\ntreatments. The proposed RCT has the potential to significantly impact current access to\r\nservices by reducing the age of starting intervention, thereby promoting optimal\r\ndevelopmental outcomes, as well as reducing burden and high health costs to families and\r\nsociety.",

    "title": "Interactive Mirroring Games wIth sOcial Robot (IOGIOCO) and Robotic System Adapted Into a Clinical Scale (RISCALE)",
    "description": "Background: The importance of early intervention in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) has\r\nbeen widely demonstrated, and developmental trajectories in ASD highlight the importance\r\nof nonverbal communication, such as intransitive gesture production, as a possible\r\npositive prognostic factor for language development. The use of technological tools in\r\nthe therapy of individuals with ASD has also become increasingly important due to their\r\nincreased engagement and responsiveness to technological objects, such as robots.\r\n\r\nMaterials and methods: We developed a training protocol using the humanoid robot NAO,\r\ncalled IOGIOCO (Interactive mirroring Games wIth sOCial rObot), based on the use of\r\nintransitive gestures embedded in naturalistic dialogues, stimulating a triadic\r\ninteraction between child, robot and therapist. The training is divided into six levels;\r\nthe first 2 levels were called \"familiarization levels,\" and the other 4 were \"training\r\nlevels\". The technological setup includes different complexity levels, from mirroring\r\ntasks to building spontaneous interactions. We previously tested the protocol on 10\r\npreschool children with ASD (aged 2-6 years) in a pilot study founding promising results\r\n(Annunziata et al,2024). We therefore developed a Randomized Controlled Trial to test the\r\nefficacy of this intervention.\r\n\r\nThe project is to be divided into three phases.\r\n\r\n  1. Establishment, adaptation, and subsequent validation of the video recording setting,\r\n     accompanied by the identification of the quantitative parameters discernible through\r\n     technological tools (ECSP-I_rob) on a sample of typically developing children aged\r\n     between 18 and 24 months.\r\n\r\n  2. Setting, adaptation, and and subsequently validate the video recording setting with\r\n     the measurement of the quantitative parameters detectable through technological\r\n     tools (ECSP-I_rob) on a sample of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder under the\r\n     age of 72 months.\r\n\r\n  3) Initiate training with NAO on a group of children with ASD aged 24-72 months with\r\n     pre- and post-treatment ECSP-I administration\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n\r\n  1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the robot-based intervention on social-communicative\r\n     skills and in the acquisition of intransitive gestures used for communicative\r\n     purposes using the ECSP-I and the MacArthur questionnaire as outcome measures.\r\n\r\n  2. Identify and describe measurable parameters of \"social\" interaction within the\r\n     rehabilitation session with NAO and the operator. Furthermore, it is essential to\r\n     verify their evolution and differences at the beginning and end of treatment and\r\n     between the different social partners.\r\n\r\nWe aim to enroll 20 typical children aged 18-24 months to validate the ECSP-I robot.\r\n\r\nFor the phase 2 and 3 we aim to enroll 20 ASD preschool children with an ASD diagnosis\r\naccording to DSM-5 criteria (confirmed by ADOS-2). We will test them at T0\r\n(Griffiths-III, ABAS-II, MacArthur-Bates number of gestures) and randomly assign them to\r\ntwo groups, G1 and G2, according to a cross-over design. After T0 assessment, Group 1\r\nwill undergo to a 12-weekly-session training with the social robot NAO, while G2 will\r\ncontinue the therapy as usual. We will assess again at T1 (after 12 sessions, through\r\nABAS-II and MacArthur-Bates), subsequently G1 will be included in a follow-up group,\r\nwhile the G2 will undergo to the social robot intervention. We will assess all the\r\nparticipants at T2; we will moreover administrate a satisfaction questionnaire to\r\nparents.",

The study aims to evaluate whether sensory overlap (simultaneous stimuli)\r\nincreases cognitive load and decreases performance, while stimulus separation (separate\r\npresentation of visual and auditory stimuli) may facilitate processing and improve\r\nperformance, especially in participants with ASC. Participants will be divided into two\r\nmain groups: the first consisting of individuals with ASD and the second of neurotypical\r\nindividuals. Each group will be exposed to two modes of stimulus presentation:\r\nsimultaneous mode, in which visual and auditory stimuli are presented at the same time,\r\nand separate mode, in which visual and auditory stimuli are presented separately with a\r\ntime interval between each. Participants will be required to complete visual-auditory\r\nassociation tasks. In addition to assessment of reaction time and accuracy,\r\npsychophysiological parameters will be recorded to measure cognitive load and\r\nphysiological reaction to stimuli. The main hypotheses are that the simultaneous\r\npresentation of visual and auditory stimuli will increase cognitive load and reduce\r\naccuracy and reaction time in individuals with ASC, while the separate mode will improve\r\nperformance, especially in the group with ASC. This study could provide important\r\ninsights into how stimulus presentation mode affects learning and performance in\r\nparticipants with ASC, suggesting that stimulus separation could be a useful strategy for\r\noptimizing sensory processing and improving learning in educational and therapeutic\r\nsettings.",

    "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) that affects about\r\n78 million people worldwide. Its prevalence and degree of impact on individuals and\r\nfamilies place it among disorders of global importance. ASD resulted in 4.31 million (95%\r\nUI 2.82-6.23) global Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in 2019, equivalent to 0.2%\r\n(0.1-0.2) of DALYs and contributed to 3.4% (2.7-4.3) of DALYs for the aggregate of mental\r\ndisorders. Evidence shows that early and tailored intervention limits the impact of\r\nsymptomatology and improves the quality of life of people with ASD and other NDDs and\r\ntheir families. Early identification of clinical signs (red flags) is the first step to\r\nfacilitating prompt referral for an assessment and diagnosis. In many cases, features of\r\nASD/NDDs manifest early in development (first 6-12 months), although the specificity of\r\nthese signs is still unclear. Three infants' populations are at higher risk for\r\ndeveloping ASD/NDDs compared to the general population: siblings of children diagnosed\r\nwith ASD (18.7%), preterms, and Small for Gestational Age (SGA). In preterm infants, the\r\nprevalence of ASD has been estimated as 7% (95% IC, 4-9) and ADHD is diagnosed twice as\r\noften (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3-1.8). Moreover, the risk for developing ASD in SGA has been\r\nestimated as 1.17 (95% CI, 1.09-1.24). Setting up a system to monitor infant\r\nneurodevelopmental trajectories through a specific experimental and clinical protocol\r\nwill enable strategic preventive actions. Early detection of ASD/NDDs requires the\r\nmainstreaming of child development monitoring into Child Psychiatry Units (CPUs) and\r\nNeonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) follow-up programs of at-risk infants. Since 2010,\r\nthe ISS coordinates the Italian Network for early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorders\r\n(NIDA Network), actually involving 45 NICUs and 148 CPUs implicated in the diagnosis and\r\ntreatment of infants at risk for ASD/NDDs in all Italian Regions. Within the NIDA\r\nNetwork, the ISS implemented a clinical protocol for monitoring at-risk infants for\r\nASD/NDDs in the NICUs follow-up and CPUs. However, the implementation of the protocol in\r\nthe clinical routine practice requires human resources with specific competences in child\r\npsychiatry test scoring and motor/vocal/social behavioral analysis. The BABY@NET project\r\nwill add to 6-to-36 months well-established clinical NIDA protocol, the experimental data\r\ncollection and analysis of behavioral and neurophysiological/biological features (vocal,\r\nmotor, social, EEG, genetic/epigenetic, metabolomic, and secretome), in the first 12\r\nmonths of age, found altered in ASD/NDDs children. The existing IT platform will be\r\nimproved for collecting research data, audios/videos, tests and providing the telehealth\r\nsupport to those NICUs and CPUs that suffer from shortage of human resources and\r\ncompetences in testing and video scoring of high risk infants. Through statistical\r\nanalysis of clinical, behavioral, and neurophysiological/biological endpoints, it is\r\npossible to identify early risk signals that can significantly anticipate ASD/NDDs\r\ndiagnoses in at-risk and general populations. The clinical/experimental protocol combined\r\nwith the digital infrastructure (e-health) will be implemented in NICUs and CPUs\r\nthroughout the National Health Service (NHS) ensuring the population of at-risk newborns\r\na specialized assessment, the neurodevelopmental surveillance and activation of\r\npersonalized prevention interventions.",

Atypical behaviors, conditioning, and difficulties interacting with others are\r\nemblems of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently\r\naffects receptive language skills essential for comprehension and communication. Early\r\nintervention is crucial for optimizing language outcomes.

    "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is considered one of the commonest developmental\r\ndisabilities, characterized mainly by impairments in social performance and communicative\r\nskills, repetitive stereotypical behaviors, and restriction in interests and activities,\r\nwith a combination of sensory, cognitive, behavioral, and communication features which\r\npersist throughout life. Caminha & Lampreia specified that there is a significantly high\r\nprevalence of sensory processing dysfunctions in ASD. Sensory processing means how the\r\ncentral and peripheral nervous systems deal with the incoming sensory input from\r\ndifferent sensory organs; visual, auditory, smell, taste, tactile, proprioception, and\r\nvestibular information. Sensory processing dysfunction is the neurological dysfunction\r\naffecting the adequate reception, modulation, integration, discrimination, or\r\norganization of sensory stimuli, and the behavioral responses to the sensory input.\r\nSensory integration therapy (SIT) is a frequent type of therapy that aims to improve a\r\nchild's ability to perceive and integrate sensory input in order to explore more ordered\r\nand appropriate actions. SIT improves motor skills, social relationships, attention,\r\nbehavior control, language and pre-linguistic communicative abilities, reading\r\ncomprehension, participation in play activities, and personal identification. Therefore,\r\nthe need for further explicit assessment of sensory integration intervention among ASD\r\nchildren has been increased to identify its gains in social and verbal interactions.

Research purpose This study uses cranial microcurrent stimulation (CES) to improve\r\n     cognition, anxiety, depression, sleep and other conditions in patients with chronic\r\n     mental illness, with the aim of improving their quality of life.\r\n\r\n  3. Screening criteria for respondents 3.1 Inclusion criteria (Those who meet the\r\n     following criteria are suitable to participate in this study)\r\n\r\n  1. Chronic mental illness patients, 2. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) \u2265 16\r\n     points, 3. Education level is junior high school graduates or above, 4. Appropriate\r\n     oral expression ability, 5. Those who can complete the research consent form, 6.\r\n     Those who are willing to participate in this study Exclusion conditions (If you have\r\n     the following conditions, you cannot participate in this study)\r\n\r\n  1. Those with obvious risk of violence or suicide; 2. Those with cognitive impairment\r\n     diagnosed with intellectual disability or autism 4. Research Methods\r\n\r\n  1. The study was conducted at the Psychiatric Center\r\n\r\n  2. A total of 92 people were admitted, and they were randomly grouped.\r\n\r\n  3. This study is a interventional study. Before the intervention, a questionnaire must\r\n     be filled out, which takes about 30 minutes. Then CES is performed 5 times a week,\r\n     each time for 40 minutes. After completion, the questionnaire must be filled out\r\n     again. After 3 months of follow-up, another questionnaire test will be conducted.\r\n\r\n  4. Possible discomfort and treatment methods During the CES intervention, if you feel\r\n     dizzy, skin allergies, ear discomfort, or any discomfort, the intervention will be\r\n     stopped immediately and the medical team will evaluate and treat you.\r\n\r\n  5. Expected benefits of the study This study uses cranial electrostimulation (CES) to\r\n     improve cognition, anxiety, depression, sleep and other conditions in patients with\r\n     chronic mental illness, with the aim of improving their quality of life.\r\n\r\n6 Matters that respondents should cooperate with during the research Express your true\r\ninner thoughts on the questionnaire content. 7 Confidentiality This study collects data\r\nthrough questionnaires.

    "title": "Brief Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for Adolescent OCD in Routine Clinical Practice",
    "description": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common and often disabling condition in young\r\npeople, characterised by distressing, intrusive thoughts, images or urges, and repetitive\r\nbehaviours intended to reduce discomfort or prevent harm. Around 1% of adolescents in the\r\nUK experience OCD, with many cases beginning in childhood or adolescence. Cognitive\r\nBehavioural Therapy (CBT) is the recommended treatment for OCD in young people, but\r\naccess to treatment is limited due to high demand, long waiting lists, and lack of\r\ntrained clinicians.\r\n\r\nA brief form of CBT for OCD, supported by workbooks, has previously shown promising\r\nresults in research settings. However, it remains unclear whether this approach is\r\nfeasible, acceptable, and effective when delivered within routine NHS child and\r\nadolescent mental health services (CAMHS), especially for young people with co-occurring\r\nautism.\r\n\r\nThis single-arm feasibility trial aims to explore whether brief CBT can be delivered\r\neffectively in routine NHS and NHS-commissioned services to young people aged 11-18 years\r\nwith OCD as their main presenting problem. The trial will also assess whether the\r\nintervention is acceptable to young people, their parents/carers, and clinicians, and\r\nwhether outcomes are comparable to existing evidence.\r\n\r\nIntervention Overview: The brief CBT intervention consists of five core sessions, with\r\nthe option of two additional booster sessions, delivered over 24 weeks. Sessions are\r\ndelivered face-to-face by trained clinicians and last between 60 to 90 minutes. The\r\nintervention is supported by a series of co-designed workbooks to be completed by the\r\nyoung person between sessions. Parents/carers are also provided with a workbook and\r\nencouraged to support the young person's progress where appropriate. Sessions may take\r\nplace in the clinic or in other agreed settings, such as at home or school. The frequency\r\nof sessions decreases over time, with the first four sessions delivered weekly and later\r\nsessions spaced further apart.\r\n\r\nThe intervention includes psychoeducation, developing a cognitive-behavioural\r\nunderstanding of OCD, goal setting, and techniques to support motivation and engagement.\r\nA key focus is helping young people develop cognitive flexibility by testing and\r\nchallenging unhelpful beliefs that drive OCD behaviours, supported by behavioural\r\nexperiments. Parents/carers and other adults in the young person's life may also be\r\ninvolved to help generalise learning and promote progress.\r\n\r\nTrial Aims: The trial has two primary aims:\r\n\r\nTo establish whether brief CBT for OCD can be delivered with fidelity and acceptability\r\nby clinicians in NHS services, and is acceptable to young people and their families.\r\n\r\nTo explore whether the intervention is associated with significant improvements in OCD\r\nsymptoms for young people, including those with autism or high levels of autistic traits.\r\n\r\nTrial Design: The study is a single-arm feasibility trial. Between 20-30 young people\r\naged 11-18 years will be recruited alongside their parents/carers. Approximately 8-10\r\nclinicians will be trained to deliver the intervention. OCD symptoms, treatment\r\nprocesses, and acceptability will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment (12 weeks), and\r\nat 3-month follow-up (24 weeks). Additional measures will be collected before each\r\ntherapy session.\r\n\r\nQualitative interviews will be conducted with young people, parents/carers, and\r\nclinicians to understand their experiences of the intervention. Acceptability will also\r\nbe measured using standardised questionnaires completed during and after treatment.\r\n\r\nOutcomes: The primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability of the intervention,\r\nassessed through session attendance, participant engagement, clinician adherence, and\r\nfeedback from young people, parents/carers, and clinicians.\r\n\r\nSecondary outcomes include changes in OCD symptoms, responsibility beliefs, family\r\naccommodation, and overall functioning, as well as measures of anxiety and depression.\r\nData will be analysed to assess changes from baseline to post-treatment and follow-up,\r\nincluding for young people with and without autistic traits. Treatment adherence and\r\nclinician competence will also be evaluated.",
